# DigiPack 
The Digital Backpack or DigiPack is an app that will allow a fluid transition between online and offline learning. When a user comes into range of a wifi connection, the DigiPack will automatically download the requested content for offline use later. The app will also automatically upload completed assignments for the user. These upload and download requests can be queued offline to be performed when a network connection is available. It is the 2020 - 2021 Capstone Project by the DigiLearn team.

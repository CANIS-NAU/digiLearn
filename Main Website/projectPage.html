    <h2>About DigiPack</h2>
    <p>
        Together our team is creating the Digital Backpack, a mobile app designed to help student with online
        learning. Schools rely on the use of the internet and wifi more and more as technology advances, especially
        with the current pandemic. More students are doing online school now, as well as the students who
        already do school online due to sick relatives, financial issues, and more. The problem our team
        is solving by creating the Digital Backpack is to help the students who are having issues with data 
        and wifi. We want students to be able to make seach queries, and be able to pull documents and 
        assignments while offline.

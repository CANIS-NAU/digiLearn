           <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> The Digital Backpack requires many developments to become a whole.
              First and foremost a Linux-based proxy server that integrates with Google Classroom API’s
              and Google Search. It also manages necessary Oath credentials that are required for a
              user’s “account/identity” to access Google Classroom services and provides a REST API.
              Along with that, the Digital Backpack also requires a mobile app that automatically uploads
               assignments, posts, and queries as well as download new content when the mobile device establishes
                Internet connectivity. The mobile app should also display content delivered from the DigiPack
                 proxy server when the user is offline. Finally, the app should use a “first-come, first-serve”
                  prioritization for uploads and “last-in, first-out” prioritization for downloads.
                  Our project should also be able to develop for Android and IOS, and provide users
                   with feedback and a summary</li>

          <br>
          <li><strong>Envisioned Solution:</strong> Dr. Vigil-Hayes and our team have set out
            to create a solution to this problem by creating a network of "opportunistic
            content delivery" systems, or “oCDN”. As the student comes into range of any public
             wifi network, the digiPack will opportunistically connect to the internet and begin
             uploading and downloading essential content automatically.  This will allow users
             with limited internet access to connect to services such as Google Classroom,
             Khan Academy, Youtube, and potentially limitless other resources. The DigiPack will
              also submit any assignments or search queries that the user may have generated while
              they were offline. The end result will be a seamless, networked experience for
              students without internet access at home. Together, this team brings a wide range of
              skills to complete this project in the most efficient way possible. As a team we are
               also proficient in multiple coding languages, as well as bringing professional REST
               service development experience. These skills will allow us to create a mobile
               application as well as a proxy server that integrates with many interfaces.

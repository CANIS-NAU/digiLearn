<h2>Prepositional Phrase</h2>

A prepositional phrase is a group of words that consists of a <a href="../lessons/prepositions.htm">preposition</a>, its <a href="object.htm">object</a> (which will be a <a href="../lessons/nouns.htm">noun</a> or a <a href="../lessons/pronouns.htm">pronoun</a>), and any words that modify the object. For example:<br><br>

<center>
<img src="pics/prepositional_phrase.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="prepositional phrase"><br>
</center>


<h2>Easy Examples of Prepositional Phrases</h2>

In these examples, the prepositional phrase is shaded and the preposition is in bold.

<ul>
<li>A singer <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> passion </span></li>
<li>A town <span class="highlight"><b>near</b> London</span></li>
<li>Keep <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> time</span>. </li>
<li>He acts <span class="highlight"><b>without</b> thinking</span>. </li>
</ul>

It is a little bit more complicated than shown above because the noun can be anything that plays the role of a noun. For example:

<ul>
<li>It's a present <span class="highlight"><b>from</b> her</span>. </li>
(Remember that the "noun" can be a pronoun.)

<li>She stole it <span class="highlight"><b>from</b> the man across the street</span>. </li>
(Here, the noun is a <a href="noun_phrases.htm">noun phrase</a>.)

<li>It's obvious <span class="highlight"><b>from</b> what he said</span>. </li>
(Here, the noun is a <a href="noun_clauses.htm">noun clause</a>.)
</ul>

The noun that follows the preposition (i.e., everything that's shaded but not bolded in the examples) is called the <a href="object_of_a_preposition.htm">object of a preposition</a>. There will often be <a href="modifiers_modify.htm">modifiers</a> in the object of the preposition making it a <a href="noun_phrases.htm">noun phrase</a>. For example:

<ul>
<li>I sat <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> Simba</span>. </li>
(There are no modifiers in this example.)

<li>I sat <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> the wonderful Simba</span>. </li>
(With the modifiers "the" and "wonderful," the object of the preposition is now a noun phrase.)
</ul>

Here is another example:

<ul>
<li>He beat Lee<span class="highlight"> <b>without</b> trying</span>. </li>
(There are no modifiers in this example. The object of the preposition is a noun. In this case, it's a <a href="gerunds.htm">gerund</a>.)

<li>He beat Lee <span class="highlight"><b>without</b> overly trying</span>. </li>
(With the modifier "overly," the object of the preposition is a noun phrase.)
</ul>

<h2>The Function of Prepositional Phrases</h2>
Prepositional phrases function as either <a href="../lessons/adjectives.htm">adjectives</a> modifying nouns or <a href="../lessons/adjectives.htm">adverbs</a> modifying verbs. For example:<br><br>

<b>Prepositional phrases functioning as adjectives that modify nouns:</b>

<ul>
<li>Do you mean that boy <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> the corner</span>?</li>
<li>I know the policeman <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> the radio</span>.</li>
(In these two examples, the prepositional phrases are functioning as adjectives. They are modifying nouns ("that boy" and "the policeman"). As they are multi-word adjectives, these prepositional phrases are a type of <a href="adjective_phrases.htm">adjective phrase</a>.)
</ul>

<b>Prepositional phrases functioning as adverbs that modify verbs:</b>

<ul>
<li>I live <span class="highlight"><b>near</b> the stadium</span>.</li>
<li>She speaks <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> notable enthusiasm</span>.</li>
(In these two examples, the prepositional phrases are functioning as adverbs. They are modifying verbs ("live" and "speaks"). As they are multi-word adverbs, these prepositional phrases are a type of <a href="adverbial_phrases.htm">adverbial phrase</a>).
</ul>

<h2>Prepositional Phrases As Adjectives</h2>
Here are some more prepositional phrases functioning as adjectives:

<ul>
<li>Please buy the scarf <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> dots</span>. </li>
(The prepositional phrase describes the noun "scarf." We could have written "dotted scarf," which proves that "with dots" is functioning as an adjective.)

<li>The man <span class="highlight"><b>on</b> the radio </span> has a boring voice. </li>
(The prepositional phrase describes the noun "man.")

<li>Give me one <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the brown ones</span>. </li>
(The prepositional phrase describes the pronoun "one.")
</ul>

<h2>Prepositional Phrases As Adverbs</h2>
Here are some more prepositional phrases functioning as adverbs:

<ul>
<li>Lee raised his small mackerel <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> utmost pride</span>. </li>
(The prepositional phrase modifies the verb "raised." It is an adverb of manner; i.e., it tells us how he raised it. We could have written "proudly raised," which proves that "with utmost pride" is functioning as an adverb.)

<li><span class="highlight"><b>Before</b> the war</span>, Chris played football for Barnstoneworth United. </li>
(The prepositional phrase modifies the verb "played." It is an adverb of time; i.e., it tells us when he played.)

<li>Dawn is tired <span class="highlight"><b>from</b> the hike</span>. </li>
(The prepositional phrase modifies the verb "is." It is an adverb of reason; i.e., it tells us why she is tired.)

<li>Lee lives <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> that fridge</span>. </li>
(The prepositional phrase modifies the verb "lives." It is an adverb of place; i.e., it tells us where he lives.)
</ul>

<h2>Real-Life Examples of Prepositional Phrases</h2>

In these real-life examples, the prepositional phrases are functioning as adjectives:

<ul>
<li>The best defence <span class="highlight"><b>against</b> the atom bomb</span> is not to be there when it goes off. (The 1949 British Army Journal) </li>

<li>In 1938, Time Magazine chose Adolf Hitler for man <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the year</span>. </li>

<li>Red sky <span class="highlight"><b>at</b> night</span>, shepherds' delight. Blue sky <span class="highlight"><b>at</b> night</span>, day. </li>
</ul>

These prepositional phrases are functioning as adverbs:

<ul>
<li>I used to work <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> a fire-hydrant factory</span>. You couldn't park <span class="highlight"><b>near</b> the place</span>. (Comedian Steven Wright) </li>

<li>Never ruin an apology <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> an excuse</span>. (American Founding Father Benjamin Franklin) </li>

<li>This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> great force</span>. (Satirist Dorothy Parker) </li>
</ul>

In the example below, the first prepositional phrase functions as an adjective while the second functions as an adverb:

<ul>
<li>A mathematical formula <span class="highlight"><b>for</b> happiness</span>: reality divided <span class="highlight"><b>by</b> expectations</span>. There were two ways to be happy: improve your reality or lower your expectations. (Author Jodi Picoult) </li>
</ul>
It can get quite complicated. For example:

<ul>
<li>A raisin dropped <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> a glass <b>of</b> fresh champagne</span> will bounce up and down continuously <span class="highlight"><b>from</b> the bottom <b>of</b> the glass</span> <span class="highlight"><b>to</b> the top</span>. </li>
(Here, "in a glass of fresh champagne" is a prepositional phrase functioning as an adverb that includes a prepositional phrase ("of fresh champagne") functioning as an adjective. Similarly, "from the bottom of the glass to the top" is functioning as an adverb and also includes a prepositional phrase ("of the glass") functioning as an adjective.)
</ul>






<h2>Why Should I Care about Prepositional Phrases?</h2>

There are three good reasons to care about prepositional phrases.

<h2>(Reason 1) Don't treat a prepositional phrase as the subject of your verb.</h2>

Be careful when a prepositional phrase precedes a verb.

<ul>
<li>A box <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> knives</span> were found at the scene. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(Here, the subject is not "knives." It is "box." Therefore, the verb should be singular and not plural. This should read "A box of knives was found at the scene.") 

<li>A combination <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> factors</span> were the cause of the crash. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
("Combination" is singular. The subject is not "factors.")

<li>Bernard Shaw hasn't an enemy in the world, and none <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> his friends </span> like him.  (Playwright Oscar Wilde) <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(Marking this wrong is a little harsh, but try to treat "none" as singular (if for no other reason than many of your grammar-savvy readers will want it to be singular). Therefore, "none of his friends likes him" is a bit sharper.)
</ul>

Remember. Don't treat the noun in your prepositional phrase (here, "knives," "factors," and "friends") as the subject of your verb.

<h2>(Reason 2) The noun in a prepositional phrase influences the verb with an expression like "most of," "some of," "half of," "majority of" and "99 percent of."</h2> 

Be aware that the noun in your prepositional phrase can influence the verb when the subject is an <a href="indefinite_pronoun.htm">indefinite pronoun</a> (i.e., a word like "all," "any," "more," "most," and "some"), which can be singular or plural depending on context.

<ul>
<li>Most <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the cake</span> has been eaten. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The noun in the prepositional phrase ("cake") is singular. Therefore, "most" is treated as singular.)

<li>Most <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the cakes</span> have been eaten. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The noun in the prepositional phrase ("cakes") is plural. Therefore, "most" is treated as plural.)

<li>Some <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the worst mistakes <b>of</b> my life</span> have been haircuts. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Singer Jim Morrison) </li>
(The main noun in the prepositional phrase ("mistakes") is plural. Therefore, "some" is treated as plural. Note that "of my life" is just a prepositional phrase functioning as an adjective modifying "mistakes." The prepositional phrase "of the worst mistakes" is the one modifying "some," which is the subject of our verb ("have"). Yeah, it can get complicated.)
</ul>
 
When modified by a prepositional phrase, an indefinite pronoun (e.g., "most," "some," "all") copies the number of the noun in the prepositional phrase.<br><br>

Got that? Now, here's your two-for-one bonus. This ruling also applies to common terms like 
"half of," "the majority of" and "a percentage of," which can also be singular or plural. Such expressions are singular when they refer to something singular but plural when they refer to something plural. For example:

<ul>
<li>Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the people</span> are right more than half the time. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Writer Elwyn Brooks White) </li>
("Half" is plural because "people" is plural.) 

<li>Half <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the world</span> knows not how the other half lives. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Poet George Herbert) </li>
("Half" is singular because "world" is singular.)
 
<li>Ninety percent <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the politicians</span> give the other ten percent a bad reputation. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (US politician Henry Kissinger) </li>
("Ninety percent" is plural because "politicians" is plural.) 

<li>My guess is that well over eighty percent <span class="highlight"><b>of</b> the human race </span> goes without having a single original thought. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Satirist HL Mencken) </li>
("Eighty percent" is singular because "human race" is singular.) 
</ul>

<h2>(Reason 3) Avoid ambiguity when placing your prepositional phrase.</h2>

<ul>
<li>One morning, I shot an elephant <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> my pyjamas</span>. How he got into my pyjamas I'll never know. (Comedian Groucho Marx) </li>
</ul>

This well-cited joke by Groucho Marx plays on the fact that prepositional phrases can be ambiguous. Groucho knew we'd assume "in my pyjamas" was an adverb modifying "shot." His punchline, however, tells us that it was actually an adjective modifying "elephant."<br><br>

Ambiguity with prepositional phrases can be a real issue.  Look at this example:

<ul>
<li>Joe fed the shark <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> the cage</span>. </li>
(Does the prepositional phrase tell us where Joe was when he fed the shark, or does it tell us which shark Joe fed? In other words, is "in the cage" functioning as an adverb modifying "fed" or an adjective modifying "shark</i>? If you read it as an adverb (i.e., telling us where Joe was), you might assume there was just one shark. If you read it as an adjective (i.e., "the shark that was in the cage"), you would assume there were other sharks.) 
</ul>

You can usually eliminate ambiguity by rewording your sentence. (Oh, and don't be surprised if your rewording hacks your original sentence to shreds.)

<ul>
<li>Joe was <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> the cage</span> when he fed the shark. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
<li>Joe fed the shark that was <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> the cage</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
</ul>

Often, context means there is no genuine ambiguity. 
 
<ul>
<li>Never ruin an apology <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> an excuse</span>. (Benjamin Franklin) </li>
(This is clearly telling you how not to ruin an apology as opposed to telling what type of apology not to ruin (i.e., the prepositional phrase is functioning as an adverb not an adjective.)

<li>Joe hit the burglar <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> a hammer</span>. </li>
(So, who had the hammer? Often, a standalone sentence will be ambiguous (as this example is), but if the surrounding context eliminates the ambiguity, you will get away with not rewording your sentence.)
</ul>
 
The ambiguous examples so far have involved uncertainty over whether the prepositional phrase is functioning as an adverb or an adjective. Be aware that ambiguity (often humorous ambiguity) also occurs when it's unclear what a prepositional phrase is modifying.

<ul>
<li>We will not sell paraffin to anyone <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> glass bottles</span>. </li>
(What? There are people who live in glass bottles?)

<li>Simon and his mother were reunited <span class="highlight"><b>after</b> 52 years</span> <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> McDonald's</span>. </li>
(What? They spent 52 years in McDonald's?)
</ul>

When you use a prepositional phrase, do a quick check to see whether it could potentially be modifying something else in your sentence. Try to bear in mind that even though it's clear to you what it's meant to be modifying, it might not be clear to your readers.<br><br>

If your prepositional phrase is ambiguous, move it next to (usually immediately to the right of) whatever it's meant to be modifying. That usually does the trick. If that makes your sentence too unwieldy, reword your sentence.<br><br>

These examples have been fixed by moving the prepositional phrase:

<ul>
<li>We will not sell paraffin <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> glass bottles</span> to anyone. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
<li>Simon and his mother were reunited <span class="highlight"><b>in</b> McDonald's</span> <span class="highlight"><b>after</b> 52 years</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
</ul>

Let's try that with the example "Joe hit the burglar with a hammer"</i>: 

<ul>
<li>Joe hit <span class="highlight"><b>with</b> a hammer</span> the burglar. </li>
(This is too unwieldy. We need to reword it. "Joe used a hammer to hit the burglar" is an option.)
</ul>

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The noun in a prepositional phrase does not govern the verb.</li>
<ul>
<li>A list of faults has been recorded. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
("Has" is right because "list" is singular. "Faults" is plural, but that's irrelevant.)
</ul>

<li>With an expression like "some of," "most of," "half of," and "majority of," the noun that follows determines whether the subject is singular or plural.</li>
<ul>
<li>Some of the treasure is mine. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
("Is" is right because "treasure" is singular.)
<li>Some of the coins are mine. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
("Are" is right because "coins" is plural.)
</ul>

<li>Be careful with prepositional phrases because they can be ambiguous. If there's genuine ambiguity, put your prepositional phrase next to whatever it's modifying or reword your sentence.</li>

<h2>Our Story</h2>

Grammar Monster was first registered as a website in September 2003. Here is the story of how it came to be:<br><br>

<b>(1) The Booklet.</b> Written by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Craig-Shrives/e/B0071GTSRW?ref_=dbs_p_pbk_r00_abau_000000">Craig Shrives</a> (a former British Army officer), Grammar Monster started life in 2001 as a 15-page booklet designed to help work mates with their punctuation and sentence structures.<br><br>

<b>(2) The PowerPoint Presentation.</b> As photocopies of the booklet circulated, one found its way onto the desk of a senior officer, who instructed Craig to present its contents to the unit's officers as part of a staff-development morning. As a result, Grammar Monster was reformatted and turned into a series of PowerPoint lessons.<br><br>

<b>(3) The First Website.</b> Aware that he had created something potentially useful for a wider audience, Craig learned some HTML, re-reformatted the lessons, and uploaded them to the web. To make the site more interactive, he converted his teenage-years BASIC programming skills to some elementary JavaScript and added a confirmatory test to each lesson. This was 2003, the early days of the internet.<br>

<center>
<img src="images/grammar_monster_history.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="Grammar monster history">
<div class="small" style="margin: -8px 0px 20px;">Grammar Monster's development</div>
</center>

Being one of the first grammar sites on the web, Grammar Monster received a lot of attention from the world's grammarians, and, true to form, they slaughtered the content. At first, Craig defended the dogma that was evident on way too many of Grammar Monster's pages. However, as the criticisms and observations continued to flood in, he learned to embrace them and use them as leads for further research to help with tuning the site's contents.<br><br> 

<b>(4) Today's Website and Books.</b> Over the next seven years, the site grew, Craig's grammar sharpened, and the "attacks" reduced and softened. By 2010, there was sufficient safe and useful content to convert into a book, and "<a href="grammar_rules.htm">Grammar Rules</a>" (later retitled "Grammar for Grown-ups") was published by Kyle Books for the UK market. It became a best-seller. Almost a decade later, "<a href="smashing_grammar.htm">Smashing Grammar</a>" was written to offer a more academic option to the highly vocational "Grammar Rules."<br><br>

Grammar Monster continues to grow, and our content remains fully open to external scrutiny. We recognize that the observations of our visitors have helped us enormously to learn and grow, which is why we continue to include a "Help Us to Improve" form at the bottom of every single page.<br><br>

Onwards...


<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 1em;">More about Grammar Monster</h2>


<h2>American or British English?</h2>

As over 60% of Grammar Monster's visitors are American, the site is written using US writing conventions. For example, <a href="lessons/commas_the_Oxford_comma.htm">the serial comma</a> is used, <a href="lessons/quotation_(speech)_marks_punctuation_in_or_out.htm">commas appear inside quotation marks</a>, and the words "<a href="glossary/period_full_stop.htm">period</a>" and "<a href="glossary/brackets.htm">parentheses</a>" are used instead of the British "full stop" and "brackets."<br><br> 

Nevertheless, the site is intended for everyone seeking to improve their grammar, and where there are <a href="https://youtu.be/lZsPJkUbeSk"">differences between the US and UK writing conventions</a>, they are highlighted in the lessons.



<h2>How to Navigate the Grammar Monster Website</h2>
Here is a short video explaining how to navigate the Grammar Monster website. It is worth watching this if you're a tutor or a learner intending to use Grammar Monster regularly.<br><br>

<h2>Advertising and Data Protection</h2>

<b>Advertising</b>. The adverts are served through an external advertising company, predominantly using Google Ad Exchange. There are no more than four adverts on any page. While we do not control the topics of the adverts, we have opted out of displaying adult-only and gambling adverts.<br><br>

<b>Data Protection</b>. Grammar Monster does not collect or store any personal information from your visit, and we do not take payments for anything. Even our tests that pass information between tutors and their students do so using URL extensions as opposed to data uploading and retrieval.

<h2>Understanding Grammar</h2>

Understanding the grammar of a foreign language can be difficult. Whether you're learning the new language to write or speak, you will need a lot of practice and guidance to understand its grammar.<br><br>
You cannot skip this part. Avoiding grammar would be like building a home with wood, but without the glue, screws, and nails. Without grammar, your English speaking and writing will fall to pieces.

<h2>The 6 Best Tools to Improve Your Grammar</h2>

Thankfully, there are tools and methods to help you learn English grammar faster and more effectively.


<h2>(1) Preply</h2>

Learning a new language on your own can be challenging. Thankfully, you can now learn English grammar on line with the help of professionals and tutors. <a href="https://preply.com/">Preply</a> is an educational platform that pairs learners with private tutors. As the instruction is delivered remotely, students and tutors can work from any location without the need to attend classes in person.<br><br>

From basic English grammar to the most complicated conversational lessons, you can learn whatever you need with the help of an experienced tutor. On this website, you can choose between thousands of tutors from 185 countries, many of whom have English as their native language and are trained to provide you with the guidance you need.<br><br>

There are currently over 49,000 online tutors available on this website, and, as a result of such a vast choice, you can even pick the price you find most suitable. 

<h2>(2) Grammarly</h2>
Grammarly is an app that checks your grammar and word choice thoroughly. It will also explain your mistakes, which is why it is a useful learning tool. With Grammarly, there is no human transferring knowledge onto you. Nevertheless, it is a useful tool for boosting your grammar skills. If you struggle with the fundamentals of English grammar or want to detect errors in your writing, then <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/?q=grammar&utm_source=placement&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=ad1&utm_term=grammarmonster">Grammarly</a> is an excellent tool.<br><br>

The primary function of Grammarly is to proofread your writing, but Grammarly users quickly adopt the program's advice and suggestions, which is how grammar is improved. It is a rather unconventional way of learning grammar, but it is highly practical because the lessons are absorbed in bite-sized learning points every time you write something. Unlike rudimentary word processors like Word, Grammarly has a strong focus on word choice and sentence structure, and its observations are often insightful. It is available both in a free and paid versions.

<h2>(3) The British Council</h2>
The <a href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar">British Council</a> has dedicated many pages to helping people learn English more effectively, and it particularly useful for those learning from a low level. If you're wondering how to learn English grammar easily, you should definitely consider this website. It is not a traditional lesson-based website. However, it has a wealth of useful resources that combine the following:

<ul>
<li> Short grammar lessons</li>
<li> Games for practice</li>
<li> Confirmatory exercises</li>
</ul>

On the site, you can choose between different levels ranging from beginner to advanced. It is all free.


<h2>(4) Lousy Writer</h2>

Don't worry about the name! "Lousy Writer" helps you to become the opposite – a good writer. It teaches people how to communicate more effectively by breaking down sentences into their component parts and offering actionable tips. The most popular feature of <a href="http://www.lousywriter.com/">Lousy Writer</a> is its "cheat sheets," which help users to understand the trickiest concepts such as subject-verb agreement, homonyms, and possessive nouns.

<h2>(5) Hemingway</h2>

If you've used Grammarly before, this tool will seem quite familiar. It operates in the same way with the same purpose, but it has a different design, making it more intuitive to use than many of its competitors.<br><br>

As well as finding spelling and grammar errors in your writing, <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway</a> also highlights over-complex sentences and offers suggestions for improvement and simplification. If you're trying to use sentence structures that are above your current level of grammar, Hemingway will tell you and help you to master them.

<h2>(6) Grammar Monster</h2>

Our site, Grammar Monster, is currently one of the best rated websites among students for learning grammar and punctuation, but it is aimed at advanced students or native speakers, which makes it unsuitable for absolute beginners. For this reason, we advocate using tools such as tutors, software programs, and websites like the British Council until you're ready for our lessons and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChHAB-I_VMnYtXFRnXr_VLA">YouTube channel</a>.

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top: 30px;">Conclusion</h2>

In this list, we've introduced the finest tools to help you build your English grammar and writing skills. You can go a long way with the assistance of tutors, educational websites, and editing tools. However, remember this: The most important factor in mastering English grammar will be your dedication.<br><br>

<h5>Adverbs (The Quick Answer)</h5>


<h2>What is an adverb?</h2>
An adverb is a word that can modify a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Lots of adverbs end "-ly." For example:

<ul>
<li> She swims <b>quickly</b>.</li>
(Here, the adverb "quickly" modifies the verb "swims.")
<li> She is an <b>extremely</b> quick swimmer.</li>
(The adverb "extremely" modifies the adjective "quick.")
<li> She swims <b>extremely</b> <b>quickly</b>.</li>
(The adverb "extremely" modifies the adverb "quickly.")
</ul>

<h2>What do adverbs do?</h2>
When an adverb modifies a verb, it tells us how, when, where, why, how often, or how much the action is performed. Here are some examples of adverbs modifying verbs:

<ul>
<li>How: He ran <b>quickly</b>.</li>
<li>When: He ran <b>yesterday</b>.</li>
<li>Where: He ran <b>here</b>.</li>
<li>How often: He ran <b>daily</b>.</li>
<li>How much: He ran <b>fastest</b>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not all adverbs are one word.</h2>
In the examples above, every adverb is a single word, but an adverb can be made up of more than one word. For example:

<ul>
<li>How: He ran <b>at 10 miles per hour</b>.</li>
(The bold text is an adverbial phrase.)
<li>When: He ran <b>when the police arrived</b>.</li>
(The bold text is an adverbial clause.)
<li>Where: He ran <b>to the shops</b>.</li>
(adverbial phrase)
<li>Why: He ran <b>to fetch some water</b>.</li>
(This is an adverbial phrase. Look at the list above. There are no single-word adverbs that tell us why.)
<li>How often: He ran <b>every day</b>.</li>
(adverbial phrase)
<li>How much: He ran <b>quicker than me</b>.</li>
(adverbial phrase)
</ul>

<h2>Adverbs</h2>
When beginners first learn about adverbs, they are often told that adverbs end "-ly" and modify verbs. That is, of course, true, but adverbs do far more than that description suggests. Here are three key points about adverbs:

<ul>
<li><b>(Point 1) Adverbs modify verbs, but they can also modify adjectives and other adverbs</b>.<br><br>

For example:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>She sang an <span class="highlight">insanely</span> sad song <span class="highlight">extremely</span> <span class="highlight">well</span>.</li>
	(In this example, "insanely" modifies the adjective "sad," "extremely" modifies the adverb "well," and "well" modifies the verb "sang.")
	</ul>

<li><b>(Point 2) Although many adverbs end "-ly," lots do not</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li>fast, never, well, very, most, least, more, less, now, far, there</li>
	</ul>

<li><b>(Point 3) In real-life sentences, lots of adverbs are phrases or clauses (i.e., not single words)</b>.<br><br>

For example:

<table>
<tr><th>Single-Word Adverb</th><th>Adverbial Phrase</th><th>Adverbial Clause</th></tr>
<tr><td>Sell it <span class="highlight">quickly</span>.</td><td>Sell it <span class="highlight">as soon as possible</span>.</td><td>Sell it <span class="highlight">before the market closes</span>.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>A Video Summary</h2>
Here is a short video summarizing this lesson on adverbs.<br><br>

<h2>Adverbs Modifying Verbs</h2>
An adverb that modifies a verb usually tells you how, when, where, why, how often, or how much the action is performed. (NB: The ones that end "ly" are usually the ones that tell us how the action is performed, e.g., "quickly," "slowly," "carefully," "quietly.")<br><br>

Here are some examples of adverbs modifying verbs:

<ul>
<li> Anita placed the vase <span class="highlight">carefully</span> on the shelf.</li>
(The word "carefully" is an adverb. It shows how the vase was placed.)

<li> Tara walks <span class="highlight">gracefully</span>.</li>
(The word "gracefully" is an adverb. It modifies the verb "to walk.")

<li> He runs <span class="highlight">fast</span>.</li>
(The word "fast" is an adverb. It modifies the verb "to run.")

<li> You can set your watch by him. He <span class="highlight">always</span> leaves at 5 o'clock.</li>
(The word "always" is an adverb. It modifies the verb "to leave.")

<li> The dinner guests arrived <span class="highlight">early</span>.</li>
(Here, "early" modifies "to arrive.")

<li> She <span class="highlight">sometimes</span> helps us.</li>
(Here, "sometimes" modifies "to help.")

<li>Will you come <span class="highlight">quietly</span>, or do I have to use earplugs? (Comedian Spike Milligan) </li>
(Here, "quietly" modifies "to come.")

<li> I am the only person in the world I should like to know <span class="highlight">thoroughly</span>. (Playwright Oscar Wilde)</li>
(Here, "thoroughly" modifies "to know.")
</ul>

<h2>Adverbs Modifying Adjectives</h2>
If you examine the word "adverb," you could be forgiven for thinking adverbs only modify verbs (i.e., "add" to "verbs"), but adverbs can also modify adjectives and other adverbs. Here are some examples of adverbs modifying adjectives:

<ul>
<li> The <span class="highlight">horridly</span> grotesque gargoyle was undamaged by the debris.</li>
(The adverb "horridly" modifies the adjective "grotesque.")
<li> Peter had an <span class="highlight">extremely</span> ashen face.</li>
(The adverb "extremely" modifies the adjective "ashen.")
<li> <span class="highlight">Badly</span> trained dogs that fail the test will become pets.</li>
(The adverb "badly" modifies the adjective "trained.")<br>
(Note: The adjective "trained" is an adjective formed from the verb "to train." It is called a <a href="../glossary/participles.htm">participle</a>.)
<li> She wore a <span class="highlight">beautifully</span> designed dress.</li>
(The adverb "beautifully" modifies the adjective "designed.")
</ul>


<h2>Adverbs Modifying Adverbs</h2>
Here are some examples of adverbs modifying adverbs:

<ul>
<li> Peter Jackson finished his assignment <span class="highlight">remarkably</span> <span class="highlight">quickly</span>.</li>
(Here, the adverb "quickly" modifies the verb "to finish." The adverb "remarkably" modifies the adverb "quickly.")

<li>We're showing kids a world that is <span class="highlight">very</span> <span class="highlight">scantily</span> populated with women and female characters. They should see female characters taking up half the planet, which we do. (Actress Geena Davis)</li>
(In this example, the adverb "scantily" modifies the adjective "populated." The adverb "very" modifies the adverb "scantily.")

</ul>

<h2>Types of Adverb</h2>
When an adverb modifies a verb, it can often be categorized as one of the following:


<table class="gridtable">
<th>Type</th><th>Examples</th><tr>

<tr><td>Adverb of Manner<br>(<b>how</b>)</td><td>An adverb of manner tells us how an action occurs.

<ul>
<li>The lion crawled <span class="highlight">stealthily</span>. </li>
<li>Will you come <span class="highlight">quietly</span>, or do I have to use earplugs? (Comedian Spike Milligan) </li>
</ul>

(NB: Lots of adverbs of manner end "-ly.")</td</tr>

<tr><td>Adverb of Time<br>(<b>when</b> and <b>how often</b>)</td><td>An adverb of time tells us when an action occurs or how often. 

<ul>
<li>I tell him <span class="highlight">daily</span>. </li>
<li>What you plant <span class="highlight">now</span>, you will harvest <span class="highlight">later</span>. (Author Og Mandino) </li>
</ul>

(NB: Adverbs of time that tell us how often something occurs (e.g., "always," "often," "sometimes") are also known as "adverbs of frequency.")


</td</tr>

<tr><td>Adverb of Place<br>(<b>where</b>)</td><td>An adverb of place tells us where an action occurs.

<ul>
<li>I did not put it <span class="highlight">there</span>. </li>
<li>Poetry surrounds us <span class="highlight">everywhere</span>, but putting it on paper is, alas, not so easy as looking at it. (Artist Vincent Van Gogh) </li>
</ul>
</td</tr>

<tr><td>Adverb of Degree<br>(aka Adverb of Comparison)<br>(<b>how much</b>)</td><td>An adverb of degree tells us to what degree an action occurs.

<ul>
<li>He works <span class="highlight">smarter</span>. </li>
<li>Doubters make me work <span class="highlight">harder</span> to prove them wrong. (Businessman Derek Jeter) </li>
</ul>
</td</tr></table>

These are the main four categories. We'll discuss the others shortly. Don't forget that adverbs can also modify adjectives and other adverbs.

<ul>
<li>To expect the unexpected shows a <span class="highlight">thoroughly</span> modern intellect. (Playwright Oscar Wilde) </li>
(The adverb "thoroughly" modifies the adjective "modern.")
<li>If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing <span class="highlight">very</span> <span class="highlight">slowly</span>. (Burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee) </li>
(The adverb "very" modifies the adverb "slowly.")
</ul>

<h2>Adverbial Phrases and Clauses</h2>
In all the examples above, the adverbs have been single words, but multi-word adverbs are common too. Adverbs commonly come as phrases (i.e., two or more words) or clauses (i.e., two or more words containing a subject and a verb). Below are some examples of multi-word adverbs. This list also includes adverbs of condition, adverbs of concession, and adverbs of reason.

<ul>
<li>Money speaks, but it speaks <span class="highlight">with a male voice</span>. (Author Andrea Dworkin) </li>
(This is called a prepositional phrase. It's also an adverbial phrase.) 
<li>People who say they sleep <span class="highlight">like a baby does</span> usually don't have one. (Psychologist Leo J. Burke) </li>
</ul>
</td</tr>

<tr><td>Adverb of Time</td><td>An adverb of time often starts with a preposition or one of the following subordinating conjunctions: "after," "as," "as long as," "as soon as," "before," "no sooner than," "since," "until," "when," or "while."

<h2>Why Should I Care about Adverbs?</h2>

Here are the six most common writing issues related to adverbs.

<h2>(Issue 1) Use adverbs ending "-ly" sparingly.</h2>

Professional writers (particularly fiction writers) don't like adverbs that end "-ly." They consider them unnecessary clutter. If you were to attend a fiction-writing course, you would be taught to craft words that render "-ly" adverbs redundant. On that course, you would undoubtedly be shown this quote:

<ul>
<li>The road to hell is paved with adverbs. (Author Stephen King) </li>
</ul>

As Stephen King advocates, if you choose the right verb or the right dialogue, you don't need an adverb. Compare these two examples:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Extremely</span> annoyed, she stared <span class="highlight">menacingly</span> at her rival. </li>
(Critics on that course would trash this.)
<li>Infuriated, she glared at her rival. </li>
(This is far sharper.)
</ul>
Here are the three good reasons to kill a "-ly" adverb:<br><br>
 
<b>(1) The adverb is a tautology (i.e., needless repetition of an idea).</b>

<ul>
<li>She smiled <span class="highlight">happily</span>. </li>
</ul>

<b>(2) The adverb is "spoon feeding" the reader.</b>

<ul>
<li>She smiled <span class="highlight">disappointedly</span>.</li>
(By the time your readers reach this sentence, they should know from context that it's a disappointed smile. The trick is to show them, not literally tell them, that she's disappointed. It's far more engaging. Less is more.)
</ul>

Spoon-feeding with an adverb happens most commonly with verbs like said, stated, and shouted (known as verbs of attribution).

<ul>
<li>"Ow, pack that in," Rachel shrieked <span class="highlight">angrily</span>.</li>
(You can scrap the adverb if it's implicit from the dialogue or context.) 
</ul>

<b>(3) The adverb is only there because of a badly chosen verb.</b>

<ul>
<li>Sitting <span class="highlight">dejectedly</span> in its cage, the parrot looked <span class="highlight">utterly</span> unhappy. </li>
(This would cause a click-fest as those critics armed their red pens.) 
<li>Looking miserable, the parrot lay on the floor of its cage. </li>
(This is sharper. Your readers will know that parrots don't ordinarily lie on the floor.)
</ul>

Avoiding adverbs is a self-imposed restraint that many writers follow. It's like a game. Upon completing their work, professional writers will often do a text search for "ly " (note the space) to find adverbs and to re-justify their use before submission.

Remember though that if your adverb is part of the story, keep it.

<ul>
<li>Your son is <span class="highlight">surprisingly</span> handsome. </li>
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 2) Delete "very" and "extremely."</h2>

Professional writers hate adverbs such as "extremely," "really," and "very" (called <a href="../glossary/intensifier.htm">intensifiers</a>). For them, using an intensifier demonstrates a limited vocabulary. It's a fair point. If you choose the right words, you can avoid intensifiers. 

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>Don't write…</th><th>Go for something like…</th><tr>
<tr><td><span class="highlight">very</span> bad</td><td>atrocious</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="highlight">extremely</span> hungry	</td><td>ravenous</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="highlight">really</span> old	</td><td>ancient</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="highlight">incredibly</span> tired	</td><td>exhausted</td></tr>
</table>

Many writers assert that intensifiers are so useless, you should delete them even if you can't find a more descriptive word.

<ul>
<li>Ireland is great for the spirit but <span class="highlight"><strike>very</strike></span> bad for the body. (Actor Hugh Dancy) </li>
(The deletion kills a word but no meaning.) 
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Substitute "damn" every time you're inclined to write "very". Your editor will delete it, and the writing will be just as it should be. </li>
</ul>

Here's a good tip. Press "CTRL H". Put "very" in the Find box. Put nothing in the Replace box. Click Replace All. 

<h2>(Issue 3) When an adverb modifies an adjective, don't join them with a hyphen.</h2>

When an adverb modifies an adjective, don't join the two with a <a href="../punctuation/using_dashes.htm">hyphen</a>. 

<ul>
<li>I don't sleep with <span class="highlight">happily</span> married men. (Actress Britt Ekland) <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
<li>Ironically, he described himself as "a <span class="highlight">professionally</span>-qualified grammarian". <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(Don't join the adverb and the adjective with a hyphen.)
</ul>

Remember that not all adverbs end "-ly."

<ul>
<li>The beginning is the <span class="highlight">most</span>-important part of the work. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (translation of Greek philosopher Plato) </li>
</ul>

As covered next, this no-hyphen rule applies only to adverbs that are obviously adverbs (e.g., ones that end "-ly"). 
 

<h2>(Issue 4) When an adverb that could feasibly be an adjective modifies an adjective, use a hyphen.</h2>

A few adverbs (e.g., "well" and "fast") look like adjectives. To make it clear your adverb is not an adjective, you can link it to the adjective it's modifying with a hyphen. The hyphen says "these two words are one entity," making it clear they're not two adjectives.

<ul>
<li>She's a <span class="highlight">well</span>-known dog. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
(The hyphen makes it clear that the dog is famous (i.e., well-known) as opposed to well (i.e., healthy) and known (i.e., familiar).)
<li>He sold me six <span class="highlight">fast</span>-growing carp. </li>
(The hyphen makes it clear the carp are ones that grow quickly and not growing ones that can swim quickly.)
</ul>

This issue crops up occasionally with "well," and "well" is almost never used as an adjective (meaning healthy) in a chain of other adjectives. So, in real life, there's almost never any ambiguity caused by these adjectivey-looking adverbs. Therefore, the following rule will cover 99% of situations: use a hyphen with "well" when it precedes an adjective.
 
<ul>
<li>It's a <span class="highlight">well</span>-known tactic. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
(This is not really about avoiding ambiguity. It's more about protecting readers from a reading-flow stutter caused by the feasibility of ambiguity.)
<li>It's a <span class="highlight">widely</span> known tactic. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
(Don't use a hyphen with normal adverbs. They don't cause reading-flow stutters.)
</ul>

<a href="hyphens_in_compound_adjectives.htm">Read about hyphens in compound adjectives</a>.


<h2>(Issue 5) Make it clear what your adverb is modifying. </h2>

Whenever you use an adverb (a single-word or multi-word one), do a quick check to ensure it's obvious what it refers to. Here are some examples of badly placed adverbs.

<ul>
<li>Singing <span class="highlight">quickly</span> improved his stammer. </li>
(It's unclear whether quickly modifies singing or improved. This is called a <a href="../glossary/squinting_modifier.htm">squinting modifier</a>.)
<li>Peter told us <span class="highlight">after Christmas</span> that he plans to diet. </li>
(Here, after Christmas sits grammatically with told but logically with plans. This is called a <a href="../glossary/misplaced_modifier.htm">misplaced modifier</a>.)
<li>I recorded the hedgehog feeding its hoglets <span class="highlight">cautiously</span>. </li>
(It's unclear whether cautiously modifies recorded or feeding.)
</ul>

Usually a badly placed modifier can be fixed by putting it nearer to the verb it's modifying. (The top two examples can be fixed by moving the shaded text to the end. The third can be fixed by moving "cautiously" either to the left of "recorded" or to the left of "feeding," depending on the intended meaning.)<br><br> 

<a href="../glossary/squinting_modifier.htm">Read more about squinting modifiers</a>.<br>
<a href="../glossary/misplaced_modifier.htm">Read more about misplaced modifiers</a>.<br><br>

It's worth mentioning <a href="../glossary/limiting_modifiers.htm">limiting modifiers</a> (e.g., "hardly," "nearly," "only") because these commonly create logic flaws or ambiguity.

<ul>
<li>I <span class="highlight">only</span> eat candy on Halloween. No lie. (Actor Michael Trevino) <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(Logically, this means all he does on Halloween is eat candy; therefore, he doesn't work, sleep, or drink on that day. In everyday speech, we all get away with misplacing "only," but we should try to be more precise in our writing.)
<li>I eat candy <span class="highlight">only</span> on Halloween. </li>
(This is sharper. As a rule of thumb, the best place for "only" is never to the left of a verb.) 
</ul>

The two examples below are correct, but they mean different things. 

<ul>
<li>Lee copied <span class="highlight">nearly</span> all 10 of your answers. </li>
(This tells us Lee copied most of the answers.)
<li>Lee <span class="highlight">nearly</span> copied all 10 of your answers. </li>
(Here, Lee might have copied none to nine.)
</ul>

It's worth spending a second to ensure your <a href="../glossary/limiting_modifiers.htm">limiting modifiers</a> are well positioned. 

<h2>(Issue 6) Use a comma after a fronted adverbial.</h2>

When an adverbial phrase or clause is at the start of a sentence, it is usual to follow it with a comma.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">In colonial America</span>, lobster was often served to prisoners because it was so cheap and plentiful. </li>
<li><span class="highlight">One April day in 1930</span>, the BBC reported, "There is no news." </li>
<li><span class="highlight">If you're called Brad Thor</span>, people expect you to be 6 foot 4 with muscles. (Author Brad Thor) </li>
</ul>

When the adverbial is at the back, the comma can be left out. Each of these could be re-written without comma and with the shaded text at the end.<br><br>

When the adverbial is at the front, it's not a serious crime to omit the comma, but you should use one because it aids reading. When the adverbial is short (one or two words), your readers won't need helping, so you're safe to scrap the comma if you think it looks unwieldy. 

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Yesterday</span> I was a dog. <span class="highlight">Today</span> I'm a dog. <span class="highlight">Tomorrow</span> I'll probably still be a dog. Sigh! There's so little hope for advancement. (Cartoonist Charles M. Schulz via Snoopy) </li>
</ul>

<div class = "sidelink" style="margin-top: 50px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>

<ul>
<li>Try to render adverbs ending "-ly" redundant with better word choice.

<li>Have you used "very"? Yes? Delete it.

<li>Don't join an adverb to an adjective unless that adverb is "well."

<li>Put your adverbs close to what they're modifying and far from what they're not.

<h2>Adjectives</h2>

Adjectives are words that describe nouns (or pronouns). "Old," "green," and "cheerful" are examples of adjectives. (It might be useful to think of adjectives as "describing words.")<br><br>

This infographic shows where an adjective sits in relation to the noun it describes:<br><br>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 1em;">Examples of Adjectives</h2>
Here are some examples of adjectives. (In each example, the adjective is highlighted.)

<h2>Adjective Before the Noun</h2>
An adjective usually comes directly <b>before</b> the noun it describes (or "modifies," as grammarians say).

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">old</span> man</li>
<li><span class="highlight">green</span> coat</li>
<li><span class="highlight">cheerful</span> one</li>
("One" is a pronoun. Don't forget that adjectives modify pronouns too.)
</ul>

When adjectives are used like this, they're called <b>attributive adjectives</b>.

<h2>Adjective After the Noun</h2>
An adjective can come <b>after</b> the noun.

<ul>
<li>Jack was <span class="highlight">old</span>.</li>
<li>It looks <span class="highlight">green</span>.</li>
<li>He seems <span class="highlight">cheerful</span>.</li>
</ul>

In the three examples above, the adjectives follow <a href="../glossary/linking_verbs.htm">linking verbs</a> ("was," "looks," and "seems") to describe the noun or pronoun. (When adjectives are used like this, they're called <a href="../glossary/predicate_adjectives.htm">predicative adjectives</a>.)

<h2>Adjective Immediately After the Noun</h2>
Sometimes, an adjective comes <b>immediately after</b> a noun.

<ul>
<li>the Princess <span class="highlight">Royal</span></li>
<li>time <span class="highlight">immemorial</span></li>
<li>body <span class="highlight">beautiful</span></li>
<li>the best seats <span class="highlight">available</span></li>
<li>the worst manners <span class="highlight">imaginable</span></li>
</ul>   

When adjectives are used like this, they're called <b>postpositive adjectives</b>. Postpositive adjectives are more common with pronouns.
 
<ul>
<li>someone <span class="highlight">interesting</span></li>
<li>those <span class="highlight">present</span></li>
<li>something <span class="highlight">evil</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Descriptive Adjectives and Determiners</h2>
In traditional grammar, words like "his," "this," "many," and even "a" and "the" are classified as adjectives. However, in contemporary grammar, such words are classified as <a href="../glossary/determiner.htm">determiners</a> (see below). Be aware that, for many people, the word adjective refers only to descriptive adjectives. A descriptive adjective will usually fit into one of the following categories:<br>

<table>
<tr><th>Category</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>Appearance</td><td>attractive, burly, clean, dusty</td></tr>
<tr><td>Colour</td><td>azure, blue, cyan, dark</td></tr>
<tr><td>Condition</td><td>absent, broken, careful, dead</td></tr>
<tr><td>Personality</td><td>annoying, brave, complex, dizzy</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quantity</td><td>ample, bountiful, countless, deficient</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sense</td><td>aromatic, bitter, cold, deafening</td></tr>
<tr><td>Size and Shape</td><td>angular, broad, circular, deep</td></tr>
<tr><td>Time</td><td>ancient, brief, concurrent, daily</td></tr>
</table>

The rise of determiners means that we now have nine <a href="../glossary/parts_of_speech.htm">parts of speech</a> not the traditional eight.

<h2>The Difference between Adjectives and Determiners</h2>

For centuries, the term "adjective" has been used for a word type now called a <a href="../glossary/determiner.htm">determiner</a>. For example, the words "his," "this," "many" are classified as <a href="../glossary/possessive_adjectives.htm">possessive adjective</a>, <a href="../glossary/demonstrative_adjective.htm">demonstrative adjective</a>, and <a href="../glossary/indefinite_adjectives.htm">indefinite adjective</a> respectively. In contemporary grammar, however, these are classified as determiners, specifically possessive determiner, demonstrative determiner, and indefinite determiner. Of interest, such determiners are still classified as adjectives by <b>most people</b>, but this situation is changing quickly [<a href=http://ow.ly/bddp50wRi8h" target="_blank">evidence</a>].)<br><br>

Determiners indicate qualities such as the following:

<ul>
<li>Possession (e.g., "<span class="highlight">my</span> dog")</li>
<li>Specificity (e.g., "<span class="highlight">that</span> dog")</li>
<li>Quantity (e.g., "<span class="highlight">one</span> dog")</li>
<li>Definiteness (e.g., "<span class="highlight">a</span> dog")</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Four Main Differences between Adjectives and Determiners</h2>
Regardless of whether you use the word "determiner" or "adjective" for such words, this much is true: determiners are not like descriptive adjectives. Here are the four main differences between determiners and normal adjectives:<br><br>

<b>(Difference 1) A determiner cannot have a comparative form.</b>

<ul>
<li>Descriptive adjective: pretty > prettier</li>
("Prettier" is the comparative form of "pretty.")
<li>Determiner: that > [nothing fits here]</li>
(There is no comparative form.)
</ul>

<b>(Difference 2) A determiner often cannot be removed from the sentence.</b>

<ul>
<li>Descriptive adjectives removed: The <strike>young</strike> boy stole a <strike>silver</strike> watch. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This is grammatically sound with the normal adjectives removed.)
<li>Determiner: <strike>The</strike> Young boy stole <strike>a</strike> silver watch. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(The sentence is flawed with the determiners removed.)
</ul>

<b>(Difference 3) A determiner often refers back to something (i.e., it's like a <a href="pronouns.htm">pronoun</a>).</b>

<ul>
<li>Determiner: Release <b>those</b> prisoners immediately.</li>
(The determiner "those" refers back to something previously mentioned. In other words, it has an <a href="../glossary/antecedent.htm">antecedent</a> (the thing it refers to). Descriptive adjectives do not have an antecedent.)
</ul>

<b>(Difference 4) A determiner cannot be used as a <a href="../glossary/subject_complement.htm">subject complement</a>.</b>

<ul>
<li>Descriptive adjective: She is intelligent.</li>
(The descriptive adjective "intelligent" can be used after a linking verb (here, "is") and function as a subject complement.)
<li>Determiner: She is [nothing fits here].</li>
(You can't use a determiner as a subject complement. NB: If you think you've found a determiner that fits, then you've found a pronoun not a determiner.)
</ul>

Here is a brief description of the main determiners. (There is a separate page on each one.)<br><br>





<table class="topAlign">
<th width="35%">Type</th><th width="65%">Examples</th></tr>
<td><b>Possessive Determiners</b>. The possessive determiners (called "possessive adjectives" in traditional grammar) are "my," "your," "his," "her," "its," "our," "their," and "whose." A possessive determiner sits before a noun (or a pronoun) to show who (or what) owns it.</td>

<td>
<li>When a man opens a car door for <span class="highlight">his</span> wife, it's either a new car or a new wife. (Prince Philip) </li>
<li>The only time a wife listens to <span class="highlight">her</span> husband is when he's asleep. (Cartoonist Chuck Jones) </li>

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Demonstrative Determiners</b>. The demonstrative determiners (called "demonstrative adjectives" in traditional grammar) are "this," "that," "these," and "those." A demonstrative determiner makes a noun (or a pronoun) more specific by relating it to something previously mentioned or something being demonstrated.</td>

<td>
<li><span class="highlight">That</span> man's silence is wonderful to listen to. (Novelist Thomas Hardy) </li>

<td>
<li><span class="highlight">The</span> poets are only <span class="highlight">the </span> interpreters of <span class="highlight">the</span> gods. (Philosopher Socrates) </li>
<li>I'm <span class="highlight">an</span> optimist – but <span class="highlight">an</span> optimist who carries <span class="highlight">a</span> raincoat. (Prime Minister Harold Wilson) </li>

<tr>
<td><b>Numbers (or Cardinal Numbers)</b>. The cardinal numbers are "one," "two," "three," etc. (as opposed by "first," "second," "third," etc., which are known as ordinal numbers). Cardinal numbers are used to specify quantity. They are part of the group of determiners known as "quantifiers."</td>

<td>
<li>If <span class="highlight">two</span> wrongs don't make a right, try <span class="highlight">three</span> wrongs. (Canadian educator Laurence Peter) </li>

</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Indefinite Determiners</b>. The most common indefinite determiners (called "indefinite adjectives" in traditional grammar) are "no," "any," "many," "few," "several," and "some." Indefinite determiners modify nouns in a non-specific way usually relating to quantity. Like numbers, they are part of the group of determiners known as "quantifiers."</td>

<td>
<li>If you live to be one hundred, you've got it made. Very <span class="highlight">few</span> people die past that age. (Comedian George Burns) </li>

<tr>
<td><b>Interrogative Determiners</b>. The most common interrogative determiners (called "interrogative adjectives" in traditional grammar) are "which," "what," and "whose." They are used to ask questions.</td>
<td>
<li>If you decide that you're indecisive, <span class="highlight">which</span> one are you? </li>
<li><span class="highlight">What</span> hair colour do they put on bald person's driving licence? </li>

<h2>Nouns Used as Adjectives</h2>
Many words that are usually nouns can function as adjectives. For example:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">autumn</span> colours</li>
<li><span class="highlight">boat</span> race</li>
<li><span class="highlight">computer</span> shop</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Devon</span> cream</li>
<li><span class="highlight">electricity</span> board</li>
<li><span class="highlight">fruit</span> fly</li>
</ul>

Here are some real-life examples:

<ul>
<li>Not all <span class="highlight">face</span> masks are created equal. (Entrepreneur Hannah Bronfman) </li>
<li>You cannot make a revolution with <span class="highlight">silk</span> gloves. (Premier Joseph Stalin) </li>
</ul>

When used like adjectives, nouns are known as <b>attributive nouns</b>.

<h2>Participles Used as Adjectives</h2>

Formed from a verb, a <a href="../glossary/participles.htm">participle</a> is a word that can be used as an adjective. There are two types of participle:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../glossary/present_participle.htm">present participle</a> (ending -"ing")</li>
<li>The <a href="../glossary/past_participles.htm">past participle</a> (usually ending -"ed," -"d," -"t," -"en," or -"n")</li> 
</ul>

Here are some examples of participles as adjectives:

<ul>
<li>The most <span class="highlight">exciting</span> phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not "Eureka!" but "That's funny." (Writer Isaac Asimov) </li>
<li>Always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its <span class="highlight">operating</span> manual. (Author Terry Pratchett) </li>
<li>While the <span class="highlight">spoken</span> word can travel faster, you can't take it home in your hand. Only the <span class="highlight">written</span> word can be absorbed wholly at the convenience of the reader. (Educator Kingman Brewster) </li>
<li>We all have friends and <span class="highlight">loved</span> ones who say 60 is the new 30. No, it's the new 60. (Fashion model Iman) </li>
</ul>

A participle is classified as a <a href="../glossary/verbals.htm">verbal</a> (a verb form that functions as a noun or an adjective).


<h2>Infinitives Used as Adjectives</h2>
An <a href="../glossary/infinitive_form.htm">infinitive verb</a> (e.g., "to run," "to jump") can also function as an adjective. 

<ul>
<li>No human creature can give orders <span class="highlight">to love</span>. (French novelist George Sand)
(Here, the infinitive "to love" describes the noun "orders.") </li>
<li>Progress is man's ability <span class="highlight">to complicate simplicity</span>. (Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl) </li>
(An infinitive will often head its own phrase. Here, the infinitive phrase "to complicate simplicity" describes the noun "ability.")
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/infinitive_form.htm">Read more about infinitive verbs</a>.

<h2>The Order of Adjectives</h2>
When two or more adjectives are strung together, they should be ordered according to the following list:

<table class="centerfirst">
<tr><th>Placement</th><th>Type of Adjective</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><li><a href="../glossary/articles.htm">Article</a>,</li><li><a href="../glossary/demonstrative_adjective.htm">Demonstrative Determiner</a>, or</li><li><a href="../glossary/possessive_adjectives.htm">Possessive Determiner</li></td><td><li>a, an, the</li><li>this, that, those, these</li><li>my, your, his, our</li></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Quantity</td><td>one, three, ninety-nine</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Opinion or Observation</td><td>beautiful, clever, witty, well-mannered</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Size</td><td>big, medium-sized, small</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Physical Quality</td><td>thin, lumpy, cluttered</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Shape</td><td>square, round, long</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Age</td><td>young, middle-aged, old</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Colour/Color</td><td>red, blue, purple</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Origin or Religion</td><td>French, Buddhist</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Material </td><td>metal, leather, wooden</td></tr> 
<tr><td>11</td><td>Type </td><td>L-shaped, two-sided, all-purpose</td></tr> 
<tr><td>12</td><td><li>Purpose, or</li><li>Attributive Noun</li></td><td><li>mixing, drinking, cooking</li><li>service, football, head</li></td></tr>
</table>

Here is an example of a 14-adjective string (shaded) that is ordered correctly:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">my two lovely XL thin tubular new white Spanish metallic hinged correcting knee</span> braces.</li>
</ul>

Regardless of how many adjectives are used (more than 3 is rare), the established order is still followed.

<ul>
<li>That's <span class="highlight">a lovely mixing</span> bowl</li>
(1: Determiner 2: Opinion 3: Purpose)

<li>Who's nicked my <span class="highlight">two black, wooden</span> spoons?</li>
(1: Number 2: Colour 3: Material)

<li>Give your ticket to <span class="highlight">the Italian old</span> waiter. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(Age comes before origin. Therefore, "the old Italian waiter" would have been better.) 
</ul>

This list of precedence is not universally agreed, but all versions are similar. The area of most dispute is age and shape. The order can change for emphasis too. If there were two old waiters, one Italian and one Spanish, then the wrong example above would be correct, and the word "Italian" would be emphasized. <br><br>

If you're a native English speaker, you are safe to ignore this list and let your instinct guide you. (Remarkably, you already know this, even if you don't know you know it.)

<h2>Using Commas with a List of Adjectives</h2>
In order to understand when to use commas between multiple adjectives, you must learn the difference between cumulative adjectives and coordinate adjectives.<br><br>With cumulative adjectives, specificity builds with each adjective, so you cannot separate cumulative adjectives with commas, and they must follow the order of precedence in the table above. Coordinate adjectives are different. They describe the noun independently, which means they can follow any order. Coordinate adjectives should be separated with commas or the word "and." Here are some examples of each type:<br><br>

<b>Cumulative adjectives</b>:

<ul>
<li>A bright green metal mixing bowl</li>
(These are cumulative adjectives. Their order cannot be changed. They follow the precedent list. There are no commas.)
</ul>

<b>Coordinate adjectives</b>:

<ul>
<li>A green, lumpy bowl</li>
<li>A lumpy, green bowl</li>
(These are coordinate adjectives. As shown, their order can be changed. They should be separated with commas or the word "and.")
</ul>

<h2>Compound Adjectives</h2>
Not all adjectives are single words. Often, a single adjective will consist of two or more words. A single adjective with more than one word is called a <a href="../glossary/compound_adjectives.htm">compound adjective</a>. For example:

<ul>
<li>Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, <span class="highlight">close-knit</span> family in another city. (Comedian George Burns)</li>
<li>Be a <span class="highlight">good-looking</span> corpse. Leave a <span class="highlight">good-looking</span> tattoo. (Actor Ed Westwick)</li>
<li>I like the <span class="highlight">busted-nose</span> look. (Actor Peter Dinklage)</li>
</ul>

Compound adjectives are usually grouped with <a href="../punctuation/using_hyphens.htm">hyphens</a> to show they are one adjective. <br><br>

<br><br><a href="../glossary/compound_adjectives.htm">Read more about compound adjectives</a>.

<h2>Adjective Phrases</h2>
In real-life sentences, adjectives are often accompanied by <a href="../glossary/modifiers_modify.htm">modifiers</a> like <a href="adverbs.htm">adverbs</a> (e.g., "very," "extremely") and <a href="../glossary/prepositional_phrase.htm">prepositional phrases</a> (e.g., "...with me," "...about the man"). In other words, an adjective (shown in bold) will often feature in an "adjective phrase" (shaded).

<ul>
<li>My bankers are <span class="highlight">very <b>happy</b> with me</span>. (The popstar formerly known as Prince)</li>
(In this example, the adjective phrase describes "bankers.")

<li>The dragonfly is an <span class="highlight">exceptionally <b>beautiful</b></span> insect but a fierce carnivore.</li>
(Here, the adjective phrase describes "insect.")
</ul>

<h2>Adjective Clauses</h2>
The last thing to say about adjectives is that <a href="../glossary/clause.htm">clauses</a> can also function as adjectives. With an adjective clause, the clause is linked to the noun being described with a <a href="../glossary/relative_pronouns.htm">relative pronoun</a> ("who," "whom," "whose," "that," or "which") or a <a href="../glossary/relative_adverbs.htm">relative adverb</a> ("when," "where," or "why"). Like all clauses, it will have a subject and a verb.

<ul>
<li>The people <span class="highlight">who make history</span> are not the people <span class="highlight">who make it</span> but the people <span class="highlight">who make it and then write about it</span>. (Musician Julian Cope)</li>

<li>I live in that solitude <span class="highlight">which is painful in youth but delicious in the years of maturity</span>. (Physicist Albert Einstein)</li>
(It can start getting complicated. In the adjective clause above, "painful in youth" and "delicious in the years of maturity" are adjective phrases.)
</ul>

Here's a formal definition:

<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>Formal Definition for Adjective Clause</b></center><br><br>
 An adjective clause is a multi-word adjective that includes a subject and a verb.

<h2>Why Should I Care about Adjectives?</h2>

This section covers a lot of adjective-associated terms, most of which have their own pages that highlight their quirks and issues. Below are five top-level points linked to adjectives.

<h2>(Point 1) Reduce your wordcount with the right adjective.</h2>

Try to avoid using words like "very" and "extremely" to modify adjectives. Pick better adjectives.

<ul>
<li>very happy boy <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > delighted boy <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>very angry <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > livid <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>extremely posh hotel <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > luxurious hotel <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>really serious look <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > stern look <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

The examples above are not wrong, but they are not succinct. The best writing is precise and concise.

<h2>(Point 2) Reduce your wordcount by removing adjectives.</h2>

Picking the right noun can eliminate the need for an adjective.

<ul>
<li>whaling ship <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > whaler <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>disorderly crowd <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > mob <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>organized political dissenting group <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > faction <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

You can also reduce your wordcount by removing redundant adjectives.

<ul>
<li>joint cooperation <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > cooperation <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>necessary requirement <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > requirement <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>handwritten manuscript <img src="../images/cross.png"/> > manuscript <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

The examples above are not wrong, but they are not succinct. The needless repetition of a single concept is known as <a href="../glossary/tautology.htm">tautology</a>.

<h2>(Point 3) Avoid incomprehensible strings of "adjectives."</h2>

In business writing (especially with technical subjects), it is not unusual to encounter strings of attributive nouns. In each example below, the attributive-noun string is shaded. 

<ul>
<li>Factor in the <span class="highlight">service level agreement completion</span> time. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (difficult to understand)</li>
<li>Engineers will install the <span class="highlight">email retrieval process improvement</span> software. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (difficult)</li>
<li>He heads the <span class="highlight">network services provision</span> team. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (difficult)</li>
<li>The system needs a <span class="highlight">remote encryption setting</span> reset. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (difficult)</li>
</ul>

Noun strings like these are difficult to follow. If you use one, you will almost certainly bring the reading flow of your readers to a screeching halt as they stop to unpick the meaning, or, worse, they'll zone out and skim over your words without understanding them. <br><br>

To avoid such barely intelligible noun strings, do one or all of the following:

<ul>
<li>Completely rearrange the sentence. </li>
<li>Convert one of the nouns to a verb. </li>
<li>Use hyphens to highlight the compound adjectives. </li>
</ul>

Here are the reworked sentences:

<ul>
<li>Factor in the time to complete the service-level agreement. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (better)</li>
<li>Engineers will install the software to improve the email-retrieval process. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (better)</li>
<li>He heads the team providing network services. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (better)</li>
<li>The system needs a reset of the remote-encryption setting. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (better)</li>
</ul>

<h2>(Point 4) Don't complete a linking verb with an adverb.</h2>

Most writers correctly use an adjective after a linking verb.

<ul>
<li>It <b>tastes</b> nice. It <b>smells</b> nice. It <b>seems</b> nice. By Jove, it <b>is</b> nice. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

There's an issue though. For some, the linking verb "to feel" doesn't feel like a linking verb and, knowing that adverbs modify verbs, they use an adverb.

<ul>
<li>I <b>feel</b> badly for letting you down. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
("Badly" is an adverb. It should be "bad.")
</ul>


This error happens with other linking verbs too, but it's most common with "to feel."
<ul>
<li>Bad service and food <b>tasted</b> awfully. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (Title of an online restaurant review by "Vanessa")</li>
("Awfully" is an adverb. It should be "awful.")
</ul>

<h2>(Point 5) Use postpositive adjectives for emphasis.</h2>

Putting an adjective immediately after a noun (i.e., using the adjective postpositively) is a technique for creating emphasis. (The deliberate changing of normal word order for emphasis is called <a href="../glossary/anastrophe.htm">anastrophe</a>.)

<ul>
<li>I suppressed my thoughts <span class="highlight">sinful and revengeful</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>The sea <span class="highlight">stormy and perilous</span> steadily proceeded. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go concise by going precise. </li>
<li>Improve sentence flow by avoiding long attributive-noun strings. </li>
<li>Don't say you feel badly unless you're bad at feeling stuff. </li>
<li>Use an adjective postpositively to create a thought everlasting. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conjunctions</h2>

Conjunctions are words used to connect words, phrases, or clauses. There are three types of conjunctions:

<ul>
<li><b><a href="../glossary/coordinate_conjunctions.htm">Coordinating Conjunctions</a></b>. Coordinating conjunctions join like with like. For example, they join a noun with another noun or an adjective with another adjective. The most common ones are "and," "but," and "or." There are seven in total: "for," "and," "nor," "but," "or," "yet," and "so." (You can remember them using the mnemonic F.A.N.B.O.Y.S.) </li>

<li><b><a href="../glossary/subordinating_conjunctions.htm">Subordinating Conjunctions</a></b>. Subordinating conjunctions join <a href="../glossary/dependent_clause.htm">subordinate clauses</a> to <a href="../glossary/independent_clause.htm">main clauses</a>. Common examples are "although," "because," "if," "since," "unless," "until," and "while." </li>

<li><b><a href="../glossary/correlative_conjunctions.htm">Correlative Conjunctions</a></b>. Correlative conjunctions are used in pairs to join alternatives or equal elements. The most common pairs are "either/or," "neither/nor," and "not only/but also." </li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-Life Examples of Subordinating Conjunctions</h2>

The role of the subordinating conjunction and subordinate clause is to establish a time, a place, a reason, a condition or a concession for the main clause. Below are some real-life examples of subordinating conjunctions. (In these examples, the subordinating conjunctions are highlighted and the subordinate clause is bolded.)

<ul>
<li>I find television very educating. <b><span class="highlight">Every time</span> somebody turns on the set</b>, I go into the other room and read a book. (Comedian Groucho Marx) </li>
(The subordinate clause establishes a time for the main clause.)

<li><b><span class="highlight">Wherever</span> the art of medicine is loved</b>, there is also a love of humanity. (Greek physician Hippocrates) </li>
(The subordinate clause establishes a place for the main clause.)

<li>People are more violently opposed to fur than leather <b><span class="highlight">because</span> it's safer to harass rich women than motorcycle gangs</b>. </li>
(The subordinate clause establishes a reason for the main clause.)

<li>Man is ready to die for an idea, <b><span class="highlight">provided</span> that idea is not quite clear to him</b>. (Author Paul Eldridge) </li>
(The subordinate clause establishes a condition for the main clause.)

<li>I'm always ready to learn, <b><span class="highlight">although</span> I do not always like being taught</b>. (Sir Winston Churchill) </li>
(The subordinate clause establishes a concession for the main clause.)
</ul>

When a sentence has a main clause (also called an independent clause) and at least one subordinate clause (also called a dependent clause), it is known as a complex sentence.<br><br>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Coordinating Conjunctions?</h2>

There are two common questions related to coordinating conjunctions:

<h2>(Question 1) Do you put a comma before "and"?</h2>

Mostly no but sometimes yes. Unfortunately, the answer to this question isn't short. Here is a summary of the rules:

<h2>The Rule for Two Items</h2>

When "and" (or any coordinating conjunction) joins two items, don't use a comma.

<ul>
<li>Lee has eaten all the cheese <span class="highlight">and</span> biscuits. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

The whole world agrees on this point. So far so good.

However, if you think it helps your reader, you can use a comma.

<ul>
<li>The Bakerloo line runs between Elephant and Castle, <span class="highlight">and</span> Harrow and Wealdstone. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Using a comma with two list items is fairly common. It happens when the list items themselves contain commas. In this example, the comma before "and" helps readers to spot the list items faster. They could work it out, but the comma helps.)

<li>I used to watch Colombo, <span class="highlight">and</span> Cagney and Lacey. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This example also has two list items: "Colombo" and "Cagney and Lacey." This time, the comma is more important because the list items could feasibly be "Colombo and Cagney" and "Lacey".) 
</ul>

So, in summary, don't use a comma when "and" (or any other coordinating conjunction) joins two items unless it helps your readers.<br><br>

There's an important exception to this rule though. It's important exception because it's common.

<h2>The Exception to the Rule for Two Items</h2>

When your coordinate conjunction joins two (or more) <a href="../glossary/independent_clause.htm">independent clauses</a> (i.e., ones that could stand alone as individual sentences), then use a comma. 
<ul>
<li><b>I like sweet things</b>, <span class="highlight">but</span> <b>I prefer savoury dishes</b>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Here, the clauses being joined (shown in bold) could stand alone as sentences. They are independent clauses. That's why there is a comma before "but.")
 </ul>

Compare that with this:
<ul>
<li>I like sweet things <span class="highlight">but</span> prefer savoury dishes. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This is similar, but "prefer savoury dishes" is not an independent clause. It's not a sentence. That's why there's no comma before "but.")
</ul>

Here are some real-life examples:
<ul>
<li>The lion <span class="highlight">and</span> the calf shall lie down together, <span class="highlight">but</span> the calf won't get much sleep. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Film director Woody Allen) </li>
(The first coordinating conjunction ("and") joins two nouns, so no comma is required. The second ("but") joins two independent clauses, so a comma is required.)

<li>Basically, my wife was immature. I'd be at home in my bath, <span class="highlight">and</span> she'd come in <span class="highlight">and</span> sink my boats. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Woody Allen) </li>
(The first coordinating conjunction ("and") joins two independent clauses, so a comma is required. The second ("and") joins two verbs, so no comma is required.)
</ul>

Hopefully, that's all clear. But, there's a quirk: If the two "sentences" (i.e., the independent clauses) are both short, it is acceptable – for style purposes – to omit the comma.

<ul>
<li>Craig caught a bass and Lee caught a goby. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>Craig caught a bass, and Lee caught a goby. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Both versions are acceptable.)
</ul>

Look at this though:
<ul>
<li>The man caught the boy and the girl caught the dog. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(For a fleeting moment, your readers will think that the man caught "the boy and the girl". You should try to write in a way that doesn't cause your readers to stutter.) 

<li>The man caught the boy, and the girl caught the dog. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Your readers will not need to re-adjust now. This example captures why we need a comma before a coordinating conjunction that joins two independent clauses.)
</ul>

<h2>The Rule for Three or More Items</h2>

When there are three or more list items, life starts getting a little more complicated because there is no unified position on whether to use a comma with the coordinating conjunction. <br><br>

Some people will write this:

<ul>
<li>Bacon, eggs, <span class="highlight">and</span> tomatoes</li>
(The comma before the "and" is called an <a href="commas_the_Oxford_comma.htm">Oxford Comma</a>. This is the convention followed by most (but not all) Americans.)
</ul>

Some people will write this:
<ul>
<li>Bacon, eggs and tomatoes</li>
(This is the convention followed by most (but not all) Brits. The most notable exception is the Oxford University Press, after which the Oxford Comma is named.)

</ul>
There are plenty of people out there who would happily start a fight with you for not using an Oxford Comma, but there are also plenty of others who consider the Oxford Comma a waste of printer ink. In essence, it's a battle of clarity versus economy.<br><br>

Advocates of the Oxford Comma claim it eliminates ambiguity. They have a point. The Oxford Comma is certainly useful for showing the separations between the list items.

<ul>
<li>It's a good price for a mug of tea, bacon and eggs and toast</li>
(Without an Oxford Comma, this could mean (1) a mug of tea, (2) bacon, and (3) eggs and toast.)

<li>It's a good price for a mug of tea, bacon and eggs, and toast</li>
(With an Oxford Comma, the list items are clear.)
</ul>

Protestors to the Oxford Comma claim it introduces ambiguity because <a href="commas_for_parenthesis.htm">commas can be used like parentheses (brackets)</a>. Look at these two sentences:

<ul>
<li>Jack left the pub with John (a policeman) and Simon. </li>
<li>Jack left the pub with John, a policeman, and Simon. </li>
(With an Oxford Comma, this could feasibly refer to two people (like in the top example) or three people.)
</ul>

Advocates claim that the Oxford Comma actually eliminates, not creates, such ambiguity, and they routinely cite this probably apocryphal book dedication:

<ul>
<li>This book is dedicated to my parents, Ayn Rand and God. </li>
(This could feasibly be read as "…my parents (Ayn Rand and God)". The same "ambiguity" wouldn't exist with an Oxford Comma before "and.")
</ul>

So, there are arguments for and against the Oxford Comma. As it happens, you probably don't have a choice whether to adopt the Oxford Comma or not. If you live in the UK, you probably shouldn't adopt it (unless you're at Oxford). If you live in the US, you probably should. Whatever convention you go for, be consistent.<br><br>

Well, actually, be flexibly consistent. If your chosen convention creates ambiguity, break the convention. There's only one 100% rule when it comes to the Oxford Comma: clarity trumps convention.<br><br>

In other words, everyone (regardless of what convention they follow) should write this when they mean four people:

<ul>
<li>I have the twins, Joe, and Callum. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (for four people)</li>
</ul>

Remember that clarity comes first. Loyalty to, or hatred of, the Oxford Comma comes second.

<h2>(Question 2) Can you start a sentence with "And" or "But</i>?</h2>

Despite what you may have been told at school, you can start a sentence with a conjunction like "And," "Or" and "But."<br><br> 

Bear in mind though that a conjunction at the start of a sentence looks quite striking, so don't do it too often (it gets annoying quickly). However, you should definitely keep this practice in your back pocket to create an impactful start to your sentence. Think of it like this: <br><br>

"And" is an impactful way of saying "In addition"<br>
"But" is an impactful way of saying "However"<br>
"Or" is an impactful way of saying "Put another way"<br><br>

Here are some real-life examples:

<ul>
<li>And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house. <img src="../images/tick.png"/>  (US President John F Kennedy) </li>
<li>I've had a perfectly wonderful evening. But, this wasn't it. <img src="../images/tick.png"/>  (Comedian Groucho Marx) </li>
</ul>

When a conjunction starts a sentence, you could argue it's not being used to join like terms but as a link between two sentences (i.e., like a <a href="../glossary/conjunctive_adverbs.htm">conjunctive adverb</a> such as "however," "consequently," and "therefore").<br><br> 

So, the real question is not whether you can use a coordinating conjunction to start a sentence but whether "and," "but" and "or" are conjunctive adverbs as well as coordinating conjunctions. And, it seems they are. <br><br> 

Therefore, should you put a comma after your conjunction like you do with a conjunctive adverb? Well, that's up to you. If you want a pause, go for it. If you don't, don’t.

<ul>
<li>It is better to be beautiful than to be good. <span class="highlight">But</span>, it is better to be good than to be ugly. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Playwright Oscar Wilde) </li>
(The comma after "But" provides a pause. It's not a grammar thing. It's a controlling-the-flow-of-text thing.)

<li>And I will always love you. (Singer Whitney Houston) <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
(There's no pause for Whitney.) 

</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points for Coordinating Conjunctions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Don't use a comma with a coordinating conjunction that joins two items.</li>

<li>Don't use a comma with a coordinating conjunction in a list of three or more items (unless you're American or studying at Oxford). </li>

<li>Break both of the rules above if using or omitting a comma makes the text clearer.</li>

<li>Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction that joins two independent clauses. </li>

<li>You can start a sentence with a coordinating conjunction, and you can put a comma after it if you want a pause. But, don't start a sentence with a coordinating conjunction too often. It gets annoying. </li>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Subordinating Conjunctions?</h2>

As a native English speaker, you don't need to worry about whether your subordinating conjunction is heading up a clause that establishes a time, a place, a reason, a condition, or a concession. You'll do that bit naturally. <br><br>

The most common question related to subordinating conjunctions is whether to offset the subordinate clause with a comma or not. Here's the guidance: <br><br>

When a subordinate clause starts a sentence, separate it from the main clause with a comma. In each example, the subordinating conjunction is shaded and the subordinate clause is bold. 

<ul>
<li><b><span class="highlight">If</span> you shoot at mimes</b>, should you use a silencer? <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Comedian Steven Wright)</li>
<li><b><span class="highlight">Now that</span> I'm over sixty</b>, I'm veering toward respectability. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Actress Shelley Winters)</li>
</ul>

These are often called "fronted subordinate clauses." A comma is used with a fronted subordinate clause because the comma makes it clear where the main clause starts. <br><br>

When a subordinate clause ends a sentence, you can drop the comma.

<ul>
<li>Should you use a silencer <b><span class="highlight">if</span> you shoot at mimes</b>? <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>I'm veering toward respectability <b><span class="highlight">now that</span> I'm over sixty</b>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
</ul>

There's a quirk though: You can use a comma for a deliberate pause.<br><br>

As a rule, try to resist using a comma before a subordinating conjunction. However, if you want to create a pause for effect, then a comma can be used.

<ul>
<li>Money is better than poverty, <b><span class="highlight">if</span> only for financial reasons</b>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Film director Woody Allen)</li>
<li>Man is ready to die for an idea, <b><span class="highlight">provided</span> that idea is not quite clear to him</b>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

If you were told at school that a comma represents a pause, then your teacher was giving you reading advice not writing advice. There are specific rules on using commas and "to create a pause" isn't one of them, even though you'd likely get many right if you adopted that rule. That said, this is a time when a comma can be used to create a pause. That's why it's a quirk. It's also pretty common.<br><br>

Let's complicate the issue a bit. The rule that states "do not use a comma when subordinate clause follows the independent clause" is not really the rule. The real rule is "use a comma if the clause is nonessential." The problem, however, is that it's really difficult to decide whether an adverbial clause is essential or nonessential. (It is much easier with <a href="../glossary/adjective_clauses.htm">adjective clauses</a>.) As the vast majority of adverbial clauses are essential, it's pretty safe, but not entirely safe, to declare that a post-positioned (as it's called when it's at the back) subordinate clause clause isn't preceded by a comma.<br><br>

<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points for Subordinating Conjunctions</h2>

<ul>
<li>If your subordinate conjunction heads up a clause at the start of your sentence, offset the clause with a comma.</li>

<li>If your subordinate conjunction heads up a clause at the back of your sentence, don't use a comma, unless you want a pause for effect (like this one).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Correlative Conjunctions?</h2>

Correlative conjunctions are useful for keeping your writing succinct. They not only provide a succinct structure to say two things but also express how those two things relate to each other. <br><br>

Generally, correlative conjunctions don't cause native English speakers too much grief, but there are four noteworthy issues associated with correlative conjunctions. 

<h2>(Issue 1) Keep a parallel structure.</h2>

Correlative conjunctions come in pairs. You must use the same type of word after each one in the pair.
 
<ul>
<li>Lee <span class="highlight">not only</span> likes pies <span class="highlight">but also</span> cakes. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(Here, the first conjunction in the pair sits before a verb ("likes"), but the second sits before a noun ("cakes"). It's not parallel. It's untidy.)

<li>He should <span class="highlight">either</span> sell his watch <span class="highlight">or</span> his car. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(Here, the first conjunction sits before a verb ("sell"), but the second sits before a noun ("his car"). It's not parallel. Untidy.)

<li>Lee likes <span class="highlight">not only</span> pies <span class="highlight">but also</span> cakes. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>He should sell <span class="highlight">either</span> his watch <span class="highlight">or</span> his car. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(In these examples, the first and second conjunctions sit before nouns. Both examples now have parallel structures. Tidy.)

<li>Lee <span class="highlight">not only</span> likes pies <span class="highlight">but also</span> likes cakes. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>He should <span class="highlight">either</span> pawn his watch <span class="highlight">or</span> sell his car. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(In these examples, the first and second conjunctions sit before verbs. Parallel. Tidy.)
</ul>

In truth, few people would describe a non-parallel structure with correlative conjunctions as a serious error, and you'd be unlikely to create ambiguity if you committed that "crime". Nevertheless, try to use parallel terms because, firstly, parallel structures are easier to read and, secondly, you will feel some comfort knowing your sentence structure is sound.

<h2>(Issue 2) Don't use commas with correlative conjunctions. (Beware the exceptions!)</h2>

Sometimes, writers are unsure whether to use a comma with correlative conjunctions. This question arises most often with the pairing "not only/but also."

Here's the rule: Don't use commas with correlative conjunctions. 

<ul>
<li>Lee likes <span class="highlight">not only</span> pies, <span class="highlight">but also</span> cakes. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, it's a little bit more complicated than that. Here's the exception: If the second conjunction sits before an independent clause (i.e., words that could be a standalone sentence), then use a comma.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">As</span> a father has compassion on his children, <span class="highlight">so</span> God has compassion on those who fear him. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Bible, Psalm 103:13) </li>
</ul>

It is rare for an independent clause to follow a correlative conjunction, but it does happen, especially with the pairing "not only/but also."  
<ul>  
<li><span class="highlight">Not only</span> does Lee like pies, <span class="highlight">but</span> he <span class="highlight">also</span> likes cakes. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>

(Note that the subject of the independent clause ("he") splits "but also." This is necessary because the word "but" is playing two roles. We know it is part of the correlative conjunction "not only/but also," but, in this sentence, it's also a coordinating conjunction. Remember that coordinating conjunctions (e.g., "and," "or," "but") are used to join like elements. Here, it's joining two independent clauses.) 
</ul>

Also, be mindful that you might find yourself using a comma before a correlative conjunction because the comma is needed for another reason.

<ul>
<li>Lee likes <span class="highlight">not only</span> pies, especially cheese and onion, <span class="highlight">but also</span> cakes. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
(Here, the commas are offsetting "especially cheese and onion," which is just some additional information (called a <a href="../glossary/parenthesis.htm">parenthesis</a>). So, the comma before "but also" has got nothing to do with correlative conjunctions.)
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 3) Be careful with subject-verb agreement.</h2>

When the pairing "either/or" or "neither/nor" features in the subject of a verb, the verb is singular if both elements are singular.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Neither</span> the inspector <span class="highlight">nor</span> the constable <b>was</b> available for comment. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Both elements ("the inpector" and "the constable") are singular, so the verb ("was") is singular; i.e., using "were" would be wrong.)
</ul>

However, things get complicated if one of the elements is plural because there are two conventions:<br><br>

<b>Convention 1: The Proximity Rule</b>. Under this convention, the element nearest the verb determines whether it's singular or plural. 

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Neither</span> the inspector <span class="highlight">nor</span> the constables <b>were</b> available for comment. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The element nearest the verb ("constables") is plural, so the verb ("were") is plural.)
</ul>

<b>Convention 2: The Logic Rule</b>. Under this convention, if any of the elements are plural, the verb is plural. 

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Neither</span> the inspectors <span class="highlight">nor</span> the constable <b>were</b> available for comment.</li>
(Here, the first element ("inspectors") is plural, so the verb is plural. This would be wrong using The Proximity Rule.)
</ul>

So, should you use the Proximity Rule or the Logic Rule if one of your elements is plural? Well, both are common, so the quick answer is pick one and be consistent. But, there's a far better answer: satisfy both rules at once. If one of your elements is plural, deliberately put it nearest to the verb.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Either</span> the budgies <span class="highlight">or</span> the cat <b>have</b> to go.</li>
(This is correct under the Logic Rule but wrong under the Proximity Rule.) 

<li><span class="highlight">Either</span> the car <span class="highlight">or</span> the budgies <b>have</b> to go. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Here, the plural element is nearest to the verb. This is now correct under both rules. Winner.)
</ul>

This all applies to "or" by itself (i.e., without "either"). 

<h2>(Issue 4) Don't forget that "neither/nor" plays a negative role.</h2>

Be aware that "neither/nor" plays a negative role in your sentence. Be careful not to use a <a href="../glossary/double_negative.htm">double negative</a>. 

<ul>
<li>We did not discuss <span class="highlight">neither</span> the flooding <span class="highlight">nor</span> the landslide. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(This is a double negative.)
</ul>

Remember that two negatives make a positive. So, the example above means that the flooding and the landslide were discussed, which would not have been the intended meaning. Here are two better options:

<ul>
<li>We discussed <span class="highlight">neither</span> the flooding <span class="highlight">nor</span> the landslide. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
<li>We did not discuss <span class="highlight">either</span> the flooding <span class="highlight">or</span> the landslide. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
</ul>

Of course, two positives don't make a negative, but it can happen. Yeah, right.

<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points for Correlative Conjunctions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Position your correlative conjunctions in your sentence so the same type of word follows each one. In other words, use a parallel structure.</li>
 
<li>Don't use a comma with a correlative conjunction unless the words after it could be a standalone sentence (i.e., contain a subject and a verb and convey a complete idea).</li>

<li>Treat a subject that features "either/or" or "neither/nor" as singular if the elements after the conjunctions are singular. If one is plural, put it nearest to the verb and use a plural verb.</li>

<li>Don't use a negative verb with "neither/nor" otherwise you'll create a double negative.</li>

<title>Determiner | What Is a Determiner?</title>
<meta name="description" content="A determiner is a word that precedes a noun to specify quantity (e.g., two cats, many mice) or to clarify what the noun refers to (e.g., his house, those dogs, the mouse). Determiners cannot have a comparative form, and many determiners reference something else, making them like pronouns. This is how they differ from descriptive adjectives."/>

<h2>Determiner</h2>
A determiner is a word placed in front of a noun to specify quantity (e.g., "<b>one</b> dog," "<b>many</b> dogs") or to clarify what the noun refers to (e.g., "<b>my</b> dog," "<b>that</b> dog," "<b>the</b> dog"). All determiners can be classified as one of the following:

<ul>
<li>An Article (<i>a/an</i>, <i>the</i>)</li>
<li>A Demonstrative (<i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>these</i>, <i>those</i>)</li>
<li>A Possessive (<i>my</i>, <i>your</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>their</i>)</li>
<li>A Quantifier (common examples include <i>many</i>, <i>much</i>, <i>more</i>, <i>most</i>, <i>some</i>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Video Summary</h2>
Here is an 8-minute video summarizing this lesson on determiners.<br><br>
<div class="videoWrapper">
<iframe width="560" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-LbqRag28c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 3em 0em 0em;">Articles (Type of Determiner)</h2>

The articles are the words "a," "an," and "the." They define whether something is specific or unspecific. There are two types of article:

<h2>(1) The Definite Article (The)</h2>

"The" is called the <a href="definite_article.htm">definite article</a>. It defines its noun as something specific (e.g., something previously mentioned or known, something unique, something being identified by the speaker). 

<ul>
<li>This is <span class="highlight">the</span> lake.</li>
(This is a previously specified lake, i.e., one already known to the readers.)
</ul>

<h2>(2) The Indefinite Article (A, An)</h2>

"A" and "an" are called the <a href="indefinite_articles.htm">indefinite articles</a>. They define their noun as something unspecific (e.g., something generic, something mentioned for the first time).

<ul>
<li>This is <span class="highlight">a</span> lake.</li>
(This is a previously unspecified lake.)
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Articles</h2>

<ul>
<li>I'm not <span class="highlight">a</span> troublemaker. I'm <span class="highlight">the</span> troublemaker!</li>
(This means "I'm not any old troublemaker. I'm the one you've all heard of.")
<li>To <span class="highlight">the</span> uneducated, <span class="highlight">an</span> A is just three sticks. (Author AA Milne)</li>
("The uneducated" is a specific group of people. "An A" means any letter A.)
<li><span class="highlight">The</span> poets are only <span class="highlight">the</span> interpreters of <span class="highlight">the</span> gods. (Philosopher Socrates)</li>
("The poets" and "the interpreters" are being identified. "The gods" are something known.)
</ul>





<h2>Why Should I Care about Articles?</h2>

We're great at choosing between "a/an" and "the," so we don't need to delve too deeply into the rules. That said though, we're not so great at choosing between "a" and "an," and using the wrong one is by far the most common mistake involving articles. There are four noteworthy issues related to articles. 

<h2>(Issue 1) Using the wrong indefinite article.</h2>

Writers who dogmatically follow the rule that "an" precedes a <a href="vowels.htm">vowel</a> and "a" precedes a <a href="consonant.htm">consonant</a> often use the wrong indefinite article. That rule is not entirely accurate. "An" is used before a vowel <b>sound</b>, and "a" is used before a consonant <b>sound</b>. The word <b>sound</b> is important because consonants – typically in abbreviations – can create vowel sounds (e.g., <i>MOT</i>, <i>NTU</i>), and vowels can create consonant sounds (e.g., <i>unicorn</i>, <i>united</i>, <i>Ouija</i>, <i>one-off</i>).

<ul>
<li>Buy <span class="highlight">a</span> house in <span class="highlight">an</span> hour. </li>
(<i>House</i> and <i>hour</i> start with the same three letters, but <i>house</i> attracts <i>a</i>, and <i>hour</i> attracts <i>an</i>. <i>House</i> starts with a consonant sound. <i>Hour</i> starts with a vowel sound.)
<li>I had <span class="highlight">a</span> unique opportunity to strike <span class="highlight">an</span> unexpected blow. </li>
</ul>

Be mindful of the distinction between <a href="abbreviations.htm">initialism abbreviations</a> (spoken as individual letters) and <a href="acronyms.htm">acronyms</a> (spoken as words):

<ul>
<li><b>An</b> MoD official and <b>a</b> MAFF official visited <b>an</b> NBC facility of <b>a</b> NATO country. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The <i>M</i> and the <i>N</i> of the initialisms <i>MoD</i> (Ministry of Defence) and <i>NBC</i> (Nuclear Biological and Chemical) are pronounced "en" and "em." The <i>N</i> and <i>M</i> of the acronyms <i>NATO</i> (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and <i>MAFF</i> (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) are pronounced "nuh" and "muh.")
</ul>

The words <i>historic</i>, <i>historical</i>, <i>historian</i>, <i>horrific</i>, and <i>hotel</i> are worthy of special mention. These words start with a consonant sound, as soft as it might be. If you're drawn to "an historic" or "an horrific," give your aitches more "huh" until you're comfortable with using "a."

<ul>
<li>The attraction of power can be a disease, <span class="highlight">a</span> horrific disease. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Actor Liam Cunningham)</li>
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 2) Writing a job title or an office name with a capital letter.</h2>

A job title (e.g., <i>president</i>, <i>judge</i>, <i>director</i>) or the name of office (<i>parliament</i>, <i>court</i>, <i>accounts section</i>) is given a capital letter when it refers to a specific person or office, i.e., when it's a <a href="proper_nouns.htm">proper noun</a>. So, when the definite article (i.e., <i>the</i>) appears before such a title or name, there's a pretty good chance you'll need a capital letter.<br><br>

Here's the guidance: If the job title or office name is being used for its dictionary definition, i.e., as a <a href="common_nouns.htm">common noun</a>, then don't use a capital letter. However, if the job title or office name nails it down to one specific person or office, then use a capital letter. 

<ul>
<li><b>The</b> King was a king among kings. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(<i>The King</i> specifies an individual, but a <i>king</i> and <i>kings</i> do not. The first one is a proper noun. The other two are common nouns.)
<li><b>The</b> Prime Minister said: "Being a prime minister is a lonely job...you cannot lead from the crowd." <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher)</li> 
(<i>The Prime Minister</i> specifies an individual, but <i>a prime minister</i> does not.)
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 3) Capitalizing "<i>The</i>" when it starts a name (e.g., <i>The Beatles</i>).</h2>

Some names (particularly band names) start with "The" (e.g., <i>The Beatles</i>, <i>The Rolling Stones</i>, <i>The Sex Pistols</i>). When such names appear in running text, you have a choice whether to write "The" (with a capital letter) or "the." There's no consensus among the leading style guides on this point, so go with your preference. 

<ul>
<li>Did you download the The Clash album? <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(Logically, this is correct, but it's far too unwieldy. No one would write it. Most people would write "Did you download the Clash album?".)
</ul>

Bear in mind that you might stumble across this issue with foreign names. 

<ul>
<li>Gina Vitale: The restaurant is called "The La Trattoria".<br>
Michael Felgate: "The La Trattoria" means The The Trattoria.<br>
Gina Vitale: I know.</li>
(This is an extract from the 1999 Hugh Grant film Mickey Blue Eyes. With more clarity of thought, the owner might have called the restaurant "La Trattoria.") 

<li>Does it disturb anyone else that "The Los Angeles Angels" baseball team translates directly as "The The Angels Angels"? (Anon)</li>
(There's no fix for this one. Just go with it.)
</ul>

<div class="sidelink">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use "an" before a vowel sound and "a" before a consonant sound.</li>
<li>When a job title (e.g., <i>ambassador</i>) or an office name (e.g., finance office) is preceded by "an" or "a" (as opposed to <i>the</i>), write it with a lowercase letter.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 3em 0em 0em;">Demonstratives (Type of Determiner)</h2>

The demonstrative determiners (known as <a href="demonstrative_adjective.htm">demonstrative adjectives</a> in traditional grammar) are <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>these</i>, and <i>those</i>. A demonstrative determiner defines where its noun or pronoun is in relation to the speaker.<br><br>

<i>This</i> and <i>these</i> define close things (in terms of distance, psychological closeness or time). <i>That</i> and <i>those</i> define distant things.

<h2>Examples of Demonstrative Determiners</h2>

In these examples, the noun or pronoun being modified is in bold.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">This</span> <b>shark</b> is pregnant.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">That</span> <b>one</b> looks worried.	</li>	 
<li>In <span class="highlight">these</span> <b>matters</b>, the only certainty is nothing is certain. (Roman scientist Pliny the Elder)</li>
<li>I regret <span class="highlight">those</span> <b>times</b> when I've chosen the dark side. I've wasted time being unhappy. (Actress Jessica Lange)</li>
</ul>





<h2>Why Should I Care about Demonstratives?</h2>

There are three noteworthy issues related to demonstrative determiners.

<h2>(Issue 1) Make sure it's clear what your demonstrative determiner refers to.</h2>

When you use a demonstrative determiner, it's worth doing a quick check to ensure it's clear what your determiner refers to. Look at this example:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">This</span> <b>issue</b> will be raised at the AGM.</li>
(What <i>issue</i>? If you can answer this question quickly because the answer is evident in the previous nearby text, then your determiner is safe.)
</ul>

Knowing exactly what their determiners refer to, writers sometimes assume their readers do too. All too often though, readers don't. If your determiner could feasibly refer back to more than one thing, you've created ambiguity.

<ul>
<li>The talk will cover America's nationally determined contribution (NDC) and the impact of a US-China trade war. <span class="highlight">This</span> issue will also be addressed in sidebar meetings. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (ambiguous)</li>
(Most readers would assume that <i>this</i> refers to "US-China trade war" because it's physically closer to <i>this</i> than "NDC," but it's not entirely clear. It could feasibly refer to either or even both.)
</ul>

If you spot possibly ambiguity, a good option is to avoid the possessive determiner and just spell it out. ("The trade war will also be addressed in sidebar meetings" might be an option.) 

<h2>(Issue 2) Consider using a demonstrative determiner and a noun to replace an ambiguous demonstrative pronoun.</h2>

Demonstrative pronouns are just like demonstrative determiners except they stand alone and don't modify nouns. Demonstrative pronouns are even more prone to being ambiguous than demonstrative determiners.

<ul>
<li>According to his Twitter feed, Professor Smith has been selected to lead a charity climb up Mount Everest. He will cease work on Monday to prepare. <b>That</b> surprised everybody. <img src="../images/cross.png" /> (ambiguous)</li>
(It's unclear what <i>That</i> refers to. The ambiguity could be removed by using a demonstrative determiner and a noun, e.g., <i>That selection</i>, <i>That goal</i>, <i>That timing</i>, <i>That announcement</i>. There are, of course, other options to kill the ambiguous <i>That</i>, e.g., <i>His selection</i>, <i>The announcement</i>.) 
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 3) Make sure your demonstrative determiner and its noun match in number. </h2>
<i>This</i> and <i>that</i> modify singular nouns. <i>These</i> and <i>those</i> modify plural nouns. This doesn't usually cause an issue for native English speakers except with the words <i>kind</i> and <i>type</i>.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">These</span> <b>kind</b> of things. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(It should be <i>kinds</i>.)
<li><span class="highlight">Those</span> <b>type</b> of issues. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(It should be <i>types</i>.)
</ul>

<div class="sidelink">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>If it's unclear what your demonstrative determiner refers to, spell it out.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 3em 0em 0em;">Possessives (Type of Determiner)</h2>

The possessive determiners (known as <a href="possessive_adjectives.htm">possessive adjectives</a> in traditional grammar) are <i>my</i>, <i>your</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>our</i>, <i>their</i>, and <i>whose</i>. A possessive determiner sits before a noun (or a pronoun) to show who or what owns it.

<h2>Examples of Possessive Determiners</h2>

In the examples below, the nouns being modified are in bold. The table also shows how each possessive determiner corresponds to a personal pronoun.

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>Personal Pronoun</th><th>Possessive Determiner</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>I</td><td>my</td><td>I do not choose that <span class="highlight">my</span> <b>grave</b> should be dug while I am still alive. (Queen Elizabeth I)</td></tr>

</table>





<h2>Why Should I Care about Possessive Determiners? </h2>

There are two noteworthy points related to possessive determiners.

<h2>(Point 1) Use <i>their</i> instead of <i>his/her</i>.</h2>

In English, we don't have a singular non-gender-specific possessive determiner that can be used for people. (We have <i>its</i>, but you can't use <i>its</i> for people.)

<ul>
<li>Each owner is responsible for <span class="highlight">its</span> dog. <img src="../images/cross.png" />
(<i>Its</i> can't be used with people.)
</ul>

So, when your singular person could be male or female, you have two options:

<h2>(1) Use <i>their</i>.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Each owner is responsible for <span class="highlight">their</span> dog. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Using <i>their</i> to refer to a singular noun (here, <i>owner</i>) is acceptable. This is the best option.)
</ul>

<h2>(2) Use <i>his/her</i>. </h2>

<ul>
<li>Each owner is responsible for <span class="highlight">his/her</span> dog.</li>
(This is acceptable, but it's clumsy.)
</ul>

There used to be a third option:

<h2>(3) Use <i>his</i> with a caveat.</h2>

"Throughout this document <i>his</i> means <i>his/her</i>."<br>[This used to be a common caveat at the front of documents.]

<ul>
<li>Each owner is responsible for <span class="highlight">his</span> dog.</li> 
(Avoid this option. It's outdated.)
</ul>


<h2>(Point 2) Don't confuse a possessive determiner with an identical-sounding contraction.</h2>

Grammar mistakes with possessive determiners are rare, but <b>spelling</b> mistakes with possessive determiners are common. Given how common these determiners are, misspelling them (particularly if you make a habit of it) will smash your credibility. There are four common spelling mistakes with possessive determiners, but fixing all four is easy because they're all made the same way – by confusing the possessive determiner with an identical-sounding contraction.<br><br>

The contraction <i>it's</i> is not a possessive. <i>It's</i> is a contraction of <i>it is</i> or <i>it has</i>. This is a 100% rule. If you can't expand your <i>it's</i> to <i>it is</i> or <i>it has</i>, then it's wrong.

<ul>
<li>A country can be judged by the quality of <b>it's</b> proverbs. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
</ul>

To some extent, this mistake is understandable because apostrophes are used for possession (e.g., <i>the dog's nose</i>). But <i>it's</i> has nothing to do with possession. No, really, it doesn't.<br><br>

The same is true for <i>you're</i> (a contraction of <i>you are</i>), they're (a contraction of <i>they are</i>), and <i>who's</i> (a contraction of <i>who is</i> or <i>who has</i>). Do not confuse these with <i>your</i>, <i>their</i> or <i>there</i>, or <i>whose</i>.

<ul>
<li>Even if you fall on <b>you're</b> face, you're still moving forward. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(The first <i>you're</i> is wrong. The second is correct.)
<li>Forgive your enemies, but never forget <b>there</b> names. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
<li>Never go to a doctor <b>who's</b> office plants have died. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
</ul>

If you've used an apostrophe, test your apostrophe by expanding your word back into two words. If you can't, the apostrophe version is wrong.

<div class="sidelink">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use <i>their</i> to replace <i>his/her</i>.</li>
<li>If you can't expand your <i>it's</i>, <i>you're</i>, <i>they're</i> or <i>who's</i> to the two-word version, then it's wrong. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 3em 0em 0em;">Quantifiers (Type of Determiner)</h2>

Any determiner that refers, even loosely, to an amount or a quantity can be classified as a quantifier. So, numbers (<i>one dog</i>, <i>two dogs</i>) are quantifiers. Not all quantifiers are so specific though. Many refer to an undefined amount or quantity. The most common ones are <i>any</i>, <i>all</i>, <i>many</i>, <i>much</i>, <i>several</i> and <i>some</i> (these are called <i>indefinite adjectives</i> in traditional grammar).

<h2>Examples of Quantifiers</h2>

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Many</span> people would sooner die than think. In fact, they do so. (Philosopher Bertrand Russell)</li>
<li>I bought <span class="highlight">some</span> batteries, but they weren't included. (Comedian Steven Wright)</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Any</span> kid will run any errand for you, if you ask at bedtime. (Comedian Red Skelton)</li>
</ul>





<h2>Why Should I Care about Quantifiers?</h2>

Below are four commonly discussed issues related to quantifiers that precede nouns. There are more issues related to quantifiers that stand alone (called <a href="indefinite_pronoun.htm">indefinite pronouns</a> in traditional grammar).

<h2>(Issue 1) Use <i>fewer</i> with plural nouns and <i>less</i> with singular nouns.</h2>

<i>Less</i> and <i>fewer</i> are quantifiers. While there are some quirks with <a href="../easily_confused/fewer_less.htm">less and fewer</a>, the general ruling is that <i>fewer</i> is used with plural nouns while less is used with singular nouns.

<ul>
<li>A low voter turnout is an indication of <span class="highlight">fewer</span> <b>people</b> going to the polls. (Politician Dan Quayle)</li>
<li>I prefer drawing to talking. Drawing is faster, and leaves less <b>room</b> for lies. (Swiss architect Le Corbusier)</li>
</ul>

A key point is that <i>less</i> is not always a determiner, even if it precedes a noun.

<ul>
<li>The <b>less men</b> think, the more they talk. (Philosopher Montesquieu)</li>
(As it is here, <i>less</i> is commonly an adverb. When it's an adverb, <i>fewer</i> isn't an option.)
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 2) Save a word. Write "all the" not "all of the."</h2>

If you're unsure whether to use "all the" or "all of the" before a noun, use "all the" because it saves a word. If you can't bear how it sounds without "of", get over it.

<ul>
<li>You can fool <b>all the people</b> some of the time, and some of the people <b>all the time</b>, but you cannot fool <b>all the people all the time</b>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (US President Abraham Lincoln)</li>
(There must have been a strong urge to use "all of the" because it would have chimed nicely with "some of the." However, succinctness trumped rhythm. Good skills, Abe.) 
</ul>

It's not the same deal with "all my" (or any possessive determiner) or "all of my." Grammatically, both are sound, but often omitting "of" sounds too awkward. Follow in your instincts.  

<ul>
<li><b>All my friends</b> left me when I was 12. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Singer Taylor Swift)</li>
<li><b>All of my songs</b> are autobiographical. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Taylor Swift)</li>
(Both are fine. Taylor followed her instincts.)
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 3) Spell out the numbers one to nine but use numerals for the numbers 10 and above…or don't. It's your choice.</h2>

Writers frequently ask whether they should write numbers as numerals (e.g., <i>11 cats</i>) or spell them out (e.g., <i>eleven cats</i>). Well, it's a matter of style. Those who write business or technical documents tend to use numerals far more liberally than those writing stories or verse. If you want a more definitive answer though, the most common convention is to spell out the numbers one to nine but to use numerals for 10 and above. (This is by no means a rule.)

<ul>
<li>Success is falling 9 times and getting up ten. (Singer Jon Bon Jovi)</li>
</ul>

<h2>(Point 4) When writing numbers in full, hyphenate all numbers between 21 and 99 (less those divisible by 10).</h2>

Regardless of where they appear within the whole number, all numbers between 21 and 99 (except 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90) should be hyphenated. 

<ul>
<li>51 = fifty-one</li>
<li>234 = two hundred thirty-four</li> 
</ul>

Oh, if you're writing to an international audience, don't use the word "and."

<ul>
<li>3,567 = three thousand five hundred sixty-seven</li>
(There's no comma in the full version.)
<li>25,223 = twenty five thousand two hundred twenty three <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(<i>Twenty five</i> and <i>twenty three</i> should be hyphenated.)
</ul>

Brits, far more than Americans, are likely to include the word "and" when writing numbers in full. Try to avoid "and" though because it's widely used to denote a decimal point. So, many would take "one hundred <b>and</b> one" as 100.1 (not 101) and "seven hundred <b>and</b> twenty-four" as 700.24 (not 724). (Interestingly, if you adopt the no-"and" rule and start spelling out all the numbers from 1 upwards, you'll reach 1000 before you use the letter "a.")<br><br>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 3em 0em 0em;">More about Determiners</h2>

The grammar world is divided on whether determiners are classified as adjectives. In traditional grammar, determiners are classified as adjectives, but many contemporary grammarians insist that determiners aren't adjectives. This situation is unhelpful because terms like "possessive adjective" are still commonly used, particularly on foreign-language courses. Anyway, whatever side of that debate you're on, this much is true: there are some big differences between normal adjectives and determiners.

<h2>(Big Difference 1) Unlike a normal adjective, a determiner cannot have a comparative form.</h2>

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>Normal Adjective</th><th>Comparative Form</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>Happy</b> otters</td><td><b>Happier</b> otters</td></tr>
</table>

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>Determiner</th><th>Comparative Form</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class="highlight">Those</span> otters</td><td>There are no <a href="comparatives.htm">comparative forms</a> of determiners.</td></tr>
</table>



<h2>(Big Difference 2) Unlike a normal adjective, a determiner often cannot be removed from the sentence.</h2>

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>A sentence with adjectives and determiners</th><th>Adjectives Removed</th><th>Determiners Removed</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class="highlight">The</span> <b>hungry</b> herons visited <span class="highlight">our</span> <b>fishing</b> lake.</td><td><span class="highlight">The</span> herons visited <span class="highlight">our</span> lake.</td><td>Hungry herons visited fishing lake. <img src="../images/cross.png" /> (It doesn't work.)</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>(Big Difference 3) Unlike a normal adjective, a determiner can have an antecedent (i.e., something it refers back to).</h2>

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">The</span> <b>hungry</b> herons visited <span class="highlight">our</span> <b>fishing</b> lake.</li>
(Often a determiner refers back to something previously mentioned. In this example, <i><span class="highlight">the</span> herons</i> tells us we're talking about herons that we've already discussed. Similarly, <i><span class="highlight">our</span></i> refers back to some people. Normal adjectives (e.g., <i>hungry</i> and <i>fishing</i>) don't refer back to things; i.e., they don't have <a href="antecedent.htm">antecedents</a>.)
</ul>









<h2>Why Should I Care about Determiners?</h2>

We've covered the issues with determiners as we looked at each type. Those aside, it will be worth learning about determiners if you have young children because determiners feature in the primary-school grammar curriculum. Your child is likely to get questions like these:

<h5>The Quick Answer</h5>


An interjection is a word added to a sentence to convey an emotion or a sentiment such as surprise, disgust, joy, excitement, or enthusiasm. For example:

<ul>
<li><b>No</b>, go away.</li>
("No" is the interjection.)
<li><b>Indeed</b>, I intend to leave as soon as possible.</li>
("Indeed" is the interjection.)
</ul>

<h2>Interjections</h2>

Interjections are words used to express strong feeling or sudden emotion. They are included in a sentence (usually at the start) to express a sentiment such as surprise, disgust, joy, excitement, or enthusiasm.<br><br>

An interjection is not grammatically related to any other part of the sentence.


<h2>A Video Summary</h2>
Here is a short video summarizing this lesson on interjections.<br><br>
<div class="videoWrapper">
<iframe width="560" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0GISr5StEc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>



<h2>Examples of Interjections</h2>
In the following examples, the interjections are shaded.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Hey</span>! Get off that floor!</li>

<li><span class="highlight">Oh</span>, that is a surprise.</li>

<li><span class="highlight">Good</span>! Now we can move on.</li>

<li><span class="highlight">Jeepers</span>, that was close.</li>
</ul>


<center>
<img src="pics/interjections.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="interjections grammar"/><br>
</center>


<h2>Yes and No</h2>
Expressions such as "yes," "no," "indeed," and "well" are often used as interjections. For example:

<ul>

<li><span class="highlight">Indeed</span>, this is not the first time the stand has collapsed.</li>

<li><span class="highlight">Yes</span>, I do intend to cover the bet.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Phew!</h2>
Some interjections are sounds. For example:

<ul>

<li><span class="highlight">Phew</span>! I am not trying that again.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Humph</span>! I knew that last week.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Mmmm</span>, my compliments to the chef.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Multi-word Interjections</h2>
Some interjections are more than one word.  For example:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Oh, really</span>? I doubt that.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Holy moly</span>! She won!</li>
</ul>

They're not always at the start of a sentence.  For example:

<ul>
<li>It is cold, <span class="highlight">indeed</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Real-Life Examples of Interjections</h2>

<ul>
<li>I'm sure I don't know half the people who come to my house. <span class="highlight">Indeed</span>, for all I hear, I shouldn't like to. (Poet and playwright Oscar Wilde)</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Yes</span>, it's absolutely true that anything worth doing is worth doing poorly until you can do it well. (Author Zig Ziglar)</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Well</span>, it's 1 a.m. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids. (Homer Simpson)</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Ah!</span> Don't say you agree with me. When people agree with me, I always feel that I must be wrong. (Playwright Oscar Wilde)</li>
<li>It's smoke, and it's in flames now; and the frame is crashing to the ground, not quite to the mooring mast. <span class="highlight">Oh</span>, the humanity! (Radio journalist Herbert Morrison reporting on the 1937 Hindenburg disaster)</li>
</ul>






<h2>Why Should I Care about Interjections?</h2>
There are two common questions related to interjections.

<h2>(Question 1) What punctuation follows an interjection?</h2> 
Recognizing an interjection will help you to choose the punctuation that follows it. If your interjection is not a question (and most aren't), you have a choice. You can use a comma, a period (full stop) or an exclamation mark. Commas and periods are used for mild interjections, while exclamation marks are used for stronger expressions of emotion. Often, an interjection followed by an <a href="../glossary/exclamation_mark.htm">exclamation mark</a> will be followed by an <a href="../glossary/exclamatory_sentence.htm">exclamatory sentence</a> (i.e., one with an exclamation mark).

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Jeepers</span>! You scared the life out of me!</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Crikey</span>! Do you think before you speak?</li>
(You can't use an exclamation mark at the end of your sentence if it's a question.)
</ul>

The choice between a comma and a period depends on your desired flow of text. In other words, choose what looks good to you. If your interjection is a question, you must use a question mark. 

<ul>
<li>I always cheer up immensely if an attack is particularly wounding because I think, <span class="highlight">well</span>, if they attack one personally, it means they have not a single political argument left. (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher)</li>
(When an interjection is in the middle of the sentence, you must offset it with commas. It doesn't happen often.)
</ul>

<h2>(Question 2) Can you use interjections in business writing?</h2>

As a general rule, you should avoid using interjections in business writing, but, used very infrequently, they can be impactful and insert some pep into a document. Too much interjection-invoked pep, however, could make you look a little scatty.  

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Point</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use a comma or a period (full stop) after a mild interjection as you think looks best. For a stronger blurt of emotion, use an exclamation mark.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nouns</h2>
A noun is a word that represents a person, place, or thing. Everything we can see or talk about is represented by a word. That word is called a "noun." You might find it useful to think of a noun as a "naming word."<br><br>

Often a noun is the name for something we can touch (e.g., "lion," "cake," "computer"), but sometimes a noun names something we cannot touch (e.g., "bravery," "mile," "joy"). 

<h2>A Video Summary</h2>
Here is a short video summarizing this lesson on nouns.<br><br>

</div>
<br><br>

Here is a similar video that focuses on <a href="https://youtu.be/5sQlZNhP5OU">the different types of noun</a>.



<h2>Easy Examples of Nouns</h2>
Here are some examples of nouns. (Notice that some have capital letters. The reason for this is explained in the next section on "Common Nouns and Proper Nouns.")

<ul>
<li><b>Person</b>: soldier, Alan, cousin, lawyer</li>
<li><b>Place</b>: house, London, factory, shelter</li>
<li><b>Thing</b>. This includes:</li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Objects</b>: table, London Bridge, chisel, nitrogen, month, inch, cooking</li>
	<li><b>Animals</b>: aardvark, rat, shark, Mickey</li>
	<li><b>Ideas</b>: confusion, kindness, faith, Theory of Relativity, joy</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

Most nouns can be <a href="../glossary/plural_definition.htm">pluralized</a>, which usually involves adding "s" to the end (e.g., aardvark > aardvarks).<br><br>

<a href="plurals_forming_table.htm">Read more about forming plural nouns</a>.

<h2>Common Nouns and Proper Nouns</h2>

A noun can be categorized as either a <a href="../glossary/common_nouns.htm">common noun</a> or a <a href="../glossary/proper_nouns.htm">proper noun</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Common Noun</b>. A common noun is the word for a person, place, or thing. It's the word that appears in the dictionary. For example:

	<ul>
	<li>person</li>
	<li>city</li>
	<li>dog</li>
	</ul>

<li><b>Proper Noun</b>. A proper noun is the given name of a person, place, or thing. It's likely to be a personal name or a title. For example:

	<ul>
	<li>Michael</li>
	<li>New York</li>
	<li>Rover</li>
	(Note: A proper noun always starts with a <a href="capital_letters_proper_and_common_nouns.htm">capital letter</a>.)
	</ul>
</ul>

The difference between common nouns and proper nouns becomes clearer when they're listed side by side.<br>

<table>
<tr><th>Common Noun</th><th>Proper Noun</th></tr>
<tr><td>boy</td><td>David</td></tr>
<tr><td>sailor</td><td>Adam</td></tr>
<tr><td>lawyer</td><td>Sarah</td></tr>
<tr><td>mother-in-law</td><td>Janice</td></tr>
<tr><td>city</td><td>Boston</td></tr>
<tr><td>bridge</td><td>The Golden Gate Bridge</td></tr>
<tr><td>tower</td><td>Eifel Tower</td></tr>
<tr><td>street</td><td>Honeysuckle Crescent</td></tr>
<tr><td>cat</td><td>Fido</td></tr>
<tr><td>monkey</td><td>Bonzo</td></tr>
</table>

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>How To Spot a Common Noun and a Proper Noun</b></center><br>

A common noun answers the question "What is it?"<br>
A proper noun answers the question "What's its name?" <br><br>

Q: What is it? A: It is a <b>bridge</b>.<br>
(The word "bridge" is a common noun.)<br><br>

Q: What's its name? A: It is <b>London Bridge</b>.<br>
(The name "London Bridge" is a proper noun.)

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 1em;">More about Nouns</h2>


As well as being categorized as a common noun or a proper noun, a noun can be further categorized according to its meaning or its structure (e.g., Is it something tangible, or is it made up of more than one word?). For example:<br>

<table>
<tr><th rowspan="2">Noun Type</th><th colspan="3" style="border-bottom: 2px solid white;">Example</th></tr>
<tr><th>son-in-law</th><th>determination</th><th>committee</th></tr>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 1em;">The Function of Nouns</h2>

<h2>Nouns as Subjects, Objects, and Complements</h2>
A noun can function as a <a href="../glossary/subject.htm">subject</a>, an <a href="../glossary/object.htm">object</a>, or a <a href="../glossary/complement.htm">complement</a> within a <a href="../glossary/sentences.htm">sentence</a>. For example:<br>


<table>
<th>Role</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="../glossary/subject.htm">subject</a></b></td>
<td><li><b>Oranges</b> contain Vitamin C.</li></td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="../glossary/object.htm">object</a></b></td>
<td><li>He likes <b>oranges</b>.</li></td></tr>

<tr><td><a href="../glossary/complement.htm">complement</a></b></td>
<td><li>They are <b>oranges</b>.</li></td></tr>
</table>

There is more on the function of nouns in the "noun phrase" section below.

<h2>Attributive Nouns</h2>
A noun can also be used like an adjective to modify another noun. For example:

<ul>
<li>oxygen tank</li>
<li>diamond ring</li>
<li>car door</li>
</ul>

In these examples, the examples "oxygen," "diamond," and "car" are functioning like adjectives. When nouns are used like this, they're called "attributive nouns."<br><br>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 1em;">More about the Different Types of Noun</h2>

Here is a list of the different types of noun with examples. Each entry includes at least one key point for writers related to the type of noun.

<h2>Abstract Nouns</h2>

<a href="../glossary/abstract_nouns.htm">Abstract nouns</a> are things you cannot see or touch. For example:
<ul>
<li>bravery</li>
<li>joy</li>
<li>determination</li>
</ul>



<center>

<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>An Interesting Point about Abstract Nouns</b></center><br><br>

Many creative writers (particularly poets), consider abstract nouns "the enemy." Even though abstract nouns cover many of the topics that poets like to address (e.g., love, loss, sadness, loneliness), poets know that using abstract nouns (e.g., I was in love; she felt loneliness) tells their readers little. For creative writers, the challenge is often to capture these abstract feelings using concrete nouns.

</div>
</center>

<a href="../glossary/abstract_nouns.htm">Read more about abstract nouns</a>.

<h2>Concrete Nouns</h2>
<a href="../glossary/concrete_nouns.htm">Concrete nouns</a> are things you can see or touch. For example:

<ul>
<li>tree</li>
<li>hammer</li>
<li>cloud</li>
</ul>

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>An Interesting Point about Concrete Nouns</b></center><br>

Creative writers like to capture abstract ideas using concrete nouns. Here is an example of loss (an abstract noun) being conveyed with concrete nouns:

<ul>
<li>It's not needed anymore, the lead that hangs inside the door, and your bowl still scrapes the slated floor, when tapped by foot instead paw.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</center>


<h2>Collective Nouns</h2>

<a href="../glossary/collective_nouns.htm">Collective nouns</a> are words that denote groups. For example:
<ul>
<li>team</li>
<li>choir</li>
<li>pack</li>
</ul>

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>A Key Point about Collective Nouns</b></center><br>

Collective nouns can be treated as singular or plural. It depends on the sense of your sentence. For example:

<ul>
<li>The team <b>is</b> scheduled to arrive at 4 o'clock.</li>
<li>The team <b>are</b> wearing different novelty hats.</li>
</ul>

<a href="singular_plural_collective_noun.htm">Read more about treating collective nouns as singular and plural</a>.

</div>
</center>


<h2>Compound Nouns</h2>
<a href="../glossary/compound_nouns.htm">Compound nouns</a>  are nouns made up of more than one word. For example:

<ul>
<li>court-martial</li>
<li>pickpocket</li>
<li>water bottle</li>
</ul>

<center>

<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>Two Key Points about Compound Nouns.</b></center><br><br>

(1) Some compound nouns are two words (e.g., "peace pipe"), some are hyphenated (e.g., "play-off"), and some have become single words (e.g., "eyeopener"). And, many of them are currently transitioning through those stages. Therefore, spelling compound nouns can be a nightmare.<br>
(2) Some compound nouns form their plural by adding an "s" to the principal word, not necessarily to the end (e.g., "brothers-in-law").<br><br>

<a href="../glossary/compound_nouns.htm">Read more about compound nouns</a>.
</div>
</center>

<h2>Countable and Non-countable Nouns</h2>
A <a href="../glossary/countable_nouns.htm">countable noun</a> is a noun with both a singular and a plural form (e.g., "dog/dogs," "pie/pies"). A <a href="../glossary/non-countable_nouns.htm">non-countable noun</a> is a noun without a plural form (e.g., "oxygen, patience"). For example:<br><br>

These are countable:

<ul>
<li>mountain (singular) / mountains (plural)</li>
<li>fight / fights</li>
<li>kiss / kisses</li>
</ul>

With no plural forms, these are non-countable: 

<ul>
<li>food (always singular)</li>
<li>music (always singular)</li>
<li>water (always singular)</li>
</ul>

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>Key Points about Countable and Non-countable Nouns</b></center><br>


(1) Use "fewer" with plural nouns. Use "less" with singular nouns, but use "less" with numbers when they quantify dates or measurements.<br><br>
(2) Use "number of" with plural nouns. Use "amount of" with singular nouns. Use "quantity of" with either, especially if your concept is measurable and you want to allude to accuracy in counting.<br><br>

It can get quite technical, especially with point 2.<br><br> 

<a href="../glossary/non-countable_nouns.htm">Read more about countable and non-countable nouns</a>.
</div>
</center>

<h2>Gender-specific Nouns</h2>
<a href="../glossary/gender-specific_noun.htm">Gender-specific nouns</a> are nouns that are definitely male or female. For example:

<ul>
<li>king</li>
<li>vixen</li>
<li>actress</li>
</ul>

<center>

<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>Three Points about Gender-specific Nouns</b></center><br><br>

Here are three points related to gender:<br><br>

(1) If you're unsure whether to use "chairman" or "chairwomen," use "chair." (Many consider that "chairperson" and even "chairwoman" sound a bit contrived.)<br><br>
(2) "A blonde" is a woman. "A blond" is a man.<br><br>
(3) Some people do not identify as male or female. Therefore, word choice can be important.<br><br> 

<a href="../glossary/gender-specific_noun.htm">Read more about gender-specific nouns</a>.<br>
<a href="using_non-binary_pronouns_examples_and_test.htm">Read more about word choice for the non-binary genders</a>.

</div>
</center>


<h2>Gerunds</h2>
<a href="../glossary/gerunds.htm">Gerunds</a> are nouns that end "-ing" and that represent actions. Gerunds have verb-like properties. For example (gerunds shown in bold):

<ul>
<li>happily <b>building</b> a tower</li>
<li>quickly <b>drawing</b> the scene</li>
<li>suddenly <b>attacking</b> the enemy</li>
</ul>

In the examples above, the gerunds are modified with <a href="adverbs.htm">adverbs</a> and have <a href="../glossary/direct_object.htm">direct objects</a>. These are verb-like traits. This is what differentiates gerunds from verbal nouns. Let's dissect one more example:

<ul>
<li>Gradually <b>boiling</b> the haggis is best.</li>
(Here, the gerund "boiling" is modified by the adverb "gradually" and its direct object is "the haggis." Just like normal nouns, verbal nouns are modified with adjectives, and they can't take direct objects.
</ul>

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>A Key Point about Gerunds</b></center><br>

Gerunds are great for creating shorter, smoother sentences. For example:

<ul>
<li>The quick development of the device is necessary for an improvement in safety.</li>
(There are no gerunds in this 13-word sentence, which is stuffy and stilted.) 
<li><b>Developing</b> the device quickly is necessary for <b>improving</b> safety.</li>
(There are two gerunds in this 9-word version, which flows better and sounds more natural.)
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/gerunds.htm">Read more about gerunds</a>.

</div>
</center>



<h2>Verbal Nouns</h2>
<a href="../glossary/verbal_nouns.htm">Verbal nouns</a> are nouns derived from verbs. (Verbal nouns have no verb-like properties.) For example (verbal nouns shown in bold):

<ul>
<li>a good <b>building</b></li>
<li>a fine <b>drawing</b></li>
<li>an effective <b>attack</b></li>
</ul>

In the examples above, the verbal nouns are shown with <a href="adjectives.htm">adjectives</a> to differentiate them from gerunds (which are often confused with verbal nouns). Gerunds are modified with <a href="adverbs.htm">adverbs</a> not adjectives. Let's dissect one more example:

<ul>
<li>The ceremonial <b>cutting</b> of the cake has started.</li>
(Like gerunds, verbal nouns are derived from verbs, but, unlike gerunds, they have no verb-like properties. In this example, the verbal noun "cutting" is not showing any verb-like qualities." It is not modified by a determiner and an adjective ("the" and "ceremonial") and it requires a <a href="prepositions.htm">preposition</a> ("of") to link it to "the cake." In contrast, in the sentence "Cutting the cake carefully is key," the word "cutting" (which, despite being spelled the same, is now a gerund) is showing verb-like qualities. More specifically, it is modified with an adverb ("carefully") and has a direct object ("the chord").)
</ul>

<center>

<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>Key Points about Verbal Nouns</b></center><br><br>

Verbal nouns are usually preceded by "a or an" or "the" and followed by a preposition (e.g., "of," "in," "for"). This makes them pretty inefficient from a wordcount perspective. Also, a sentence with verbal nouns can often sound stuffy. However, verbal nouns can give an air of formality or provide emphasis. So, we should all care about verbal nouns for two reasons:<br><br>

(1) Replacing verbal nouns with verbs and gerunds will reduce your wordcount and improve sentence flow.<br><br>
(2) Sentences featuring pure verbal nouns could portray you as stuffy (bad) or authoritative (good). Employ them skilfully to tune to your needs.<br><br>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 1em;">Even More about Nouns (Noun Phrases)</h2>

It is rare to find a noun functioning by itself (i.e., without any <a href="../glossary/modifiers_modify.htm">modifiers</a>) in a sentence. 

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Man</span> proposes, but <span class="highlight">God</span> disposes. (German canon Thomas à Kempis) </li>
(This example features two nouns without any modifiers. That's rare.)
</ul>

In real life, it is far more common for a noun to be accompanied by modifiers. Here's the first list of nouns again. This time, each noun (highlighted) has at least one modifier. 

<ul>
<li><b>Person</b>: the <span class="highlight">soldier</span>, my <span class="highlight">cousin</span>, dopey <span class="highlight">Alan</span>, the greedy <span class="highlight">lawyer</span></li>
<li><b>Place</b>: the <span class="highlight">house</span> in the corner, inner <span class="highlight">London</span>, dirty <span class="highlight">factory</span>, no <span class="highlight">shelter</span></li>
<li><b>Thing</b>: This includes:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Objects</b>: this <span class="highlight">table</span>, our <span class="highlight">London Bridge</span>, the sharp <span class="highlight">chisel</span>, that <span class="highlight">nitrogen</span>, last <span class="highlight">month</span>, an <span class="highlight">inch</span>, her <span class="highlight">cooking </span></li>
	<li><b>Animals</b>: that <span class="highlight">aardvark</span>, one <span class="highlight">rat</span>, a <span class="highlight">shark</span>, funny <span class="highlight">Mickey</span></li>
	<li><b>Ideas</b>: utter <span class="highlight">confusion</span>, some <span class="highlight">kindness</span>, your <span class="highlight">faith</span>, the <span class="highlight">Theory of Relativity</span>, a <span class="highlight">joy</span></li>
	</ul>
</ul>

A noun with any sort of modifier (even it's just "a" or "the") is called a <a href="../glossary/noun_phrases.htm">noun phrase</a>. Like any noun, a noun phrase can function as a <a href="../glossary/subject.htm">subject</a>, an <a href="../glossary/object.htm">object</a>, or a <a href="../glossary/complement.htm">complement</a> within a <a href="../glossary/sentences.htm">sentence</a>. In each example below, the noun phrase is underlined and the head noun is shaded.

<ul>
<li><u><span class="highlight">Singing</span> in the bath</u> relaxes me. </li>
(Here, the noun phrase is the subject of the verb "relaxes.")
<li>I know <u>the <span class="highlight">back</span> streets</u>. </li>
(Here, the noun phrase is the direct object of the verb "know.")
<li>She was <u>the <span class="highlight">devil</span> in disguise</u>. </li>
(Here, the noun phrase is a subject complement following the linking verb "was.") 
</ul>

As most nouns feature in noun phrases, let's look quickly at the definition for "phrase."

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>Definition of "Phrase"</b></center><br>
A phrase has at least two words and functions as one part of speech.
</div>
</center>

It follows therefore that a noun phrase functions as a noun in a sentence. We can test this because we know that a noun can be replaced by a pronoun (e.g., "he," "she," "it," "them"). Looking at the examples above, we can replace each noun phrase with a pronoun.

<ul>
<li><b>It</b> relaxes me. </li>
<li>I know <b>them</b>. </li>
<li>She was <b>him</b>. </li>
</ul>
 
Here are some real-life examples of noun phrases as subjects, objects, and complements:

<ul>
<li><u>This <span class="highlight">man </span></u> has <u>a nice <span class="highlight">smile</span></u>, but he's got <u>iron <span class="highlight">teeth</span></u>. (Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko on Mikhail Gorbachev) </li>
(The noun phrase "This man" is the subject of the verb "has." The noun phrase "a nice smile" is the direct object of "has." The noun phrase "iron teeth" is the direct object of the verb "got." Here's the "pronoun test": <b>He</b> has <b>one</b>, but he's got <b>them</b>.)  

<li>I never learned from <u>a <span class="highlight">man</span> who agreed with me</u>. (Science-fiction writer Robert Heinlein) </li>
(The noun phrase "a man who agreed with me" is the <a href="../glossary/object_of_a_preposition.htm">object of the preposition</a> "from." Here's the "pronoun test": I never learned from <b>him</b>.)  

<li><u>Every <span class="highlight">man</span> of courage</u> is <u>a <span class="highlight">man</span> of his word</u>. (French dramatist Pierre Corneille) </li>
(The noun phrase "Every man of courage" is the subject of the verb "is." The noun phrase "a man of his word" is a <a href="../glossary/subject_complement.htm">subject complement</a> following the <a href="../glossary/linking_verbs.htm">linking verb</a> "is." Here's the "pronoun test": <b>He</b> is <b>one</b>.)
</ul>

It can get quite complicated. It's not unusual for nouns and noun phrases to be embedded within noun phrases. Looking at the last example, "courage" and "word" are both nouns, but they are not the head nouns of the phrases. They are both <a href="../glossary/object_of_a_preposition.htm">objects of the preposition</a> "of," sitting in <a href="../glossary/prepositional_phrase.htm">prepositional phrases</a> that modify the head nouns.<br><br>

The last thing to say about noun phrases is that they can be headed by pronouns as well as nouns, and they can be quite long.

<ul>
<li><u><span class="highlight">Anybody</span> who wants the presidency so much that he'll spend two years organizing and campaigning for it</u> is not to be trusted with the office. (Journalist David Broder) </li>
(Here, "anybody" is a pronoun. The rest of the noun phrase is an adjective clause modifying the head "noun". Here's the "pronoun test": <b>He</b> is not to be trusted with the office.)
</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 1em;">Even More about Nouns (Noun Clauses)</h2>

Let's look quickly at the definition for "clause".

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>Definition of "Clause"</b></center><br>
A clause has a subject and a verb and functions as one part of speech. 
</div>
</center>

It follows therefore that a noun clause functions as a noun in a sentence, and that means we can apply the "pronoun test."<br><br>

Lots of noun clauses start with "that," "how," or a "wh"-word (e.g., "what," "who," "which," "when," "where," "wh</i>y). Here are some easy examples. In each example, the noun clause is underlined, the subject is shaded, and the verb of the noun clause is bold.

<ul>
<li>I know <u>that <span class="highlight">the story</span> <b>is</b> true</u>. </li>
<li>I saw <u>how <span class="highlight">the accident</span> <b>happened</b></u>. </li>
<li>I understand <u>why <span class="highlight">it</span> <b>was</b> necessary</u>. </li>
<li>I know <u><span class="highlight">who</span> <b>said</b> that</u>. </li>
(Often, the opening word (i.e., "how," "that" or the "wh"-word) is the subject of the noun clause.)
</ul>

Like all nouns, a noun clause can function as a <a href="../glossary/subject.htm">subject</a>, an <a href="../glossary/object.htm">object</a>, or a <a href="../glossary/complement.htm">complement</a> within a <a href="../glossary/sentences.htm">sentence</a>. In the four examples above, the noun clauses are all objects (<a href="../glossary/direct_object.htm">direct objects</a>). Here are some more easy examples of noun clauses as subjects, objects, and complements.

<ul>
<li><u><span class="highlight">Whoever</span> <b>smelt</b> it</u> dealt it. </li>
(Here, the noun clause is a subject.)

<li>My command is <u>whatever <span class="highlight">you</span> <b>wish</b></u></li>
(Here, the noun clause is a subject complement.)

<li>I will give <u>what <span class="highlight">you</span> <b>said</b></u> some thought. </li>
(Here, the noun clause is an <a href="../glossary/indirect_object.htm">indirect object</a>. That's pretty rare.)
</ul>

Here are some real-life examples:

<ul>
<li><u>That <span class="highlight">he</span> <b>believes</b> his own story</u> is remarkable. (Jerome Blattner) </li>
(Here, the noun clause is the subject of the sentence. Starting a sentence with a noun clause starting "That" is acceptable, but it grates on lots of people's ears. Many writers prefer ""The fact that…</i>".)

<li>Light knows <u>when <span class="highlight">you</span> <b>are</b> looking at it</u>. ("Light and space" artist James Turrell) </li>
(Here, the noun clause is the direct object of the verb "knows.")
<li>It is a light thing for <u><span class="highlight">whoever</span> <b>keeps</b> his foot outside trouble</u> to advise and counsel him that suffers. (Greek tragedian Aeschylus) </li>
(Here, the noun clause is the object of a preposition ("for").)
<li>My relationships are between me and <u>whomever <span class="highlight">I</span> <b>am</b> with</u>, not between me and the world. (Actress Lili Reinhart) </li>
(Here, the noun clause is the object of a preposition ("between").)
<li>Liberty means responsibility. That is <u>why <span class="highlight">most men</span> <b>dread</b> it</u>. (Playwright George Bernard Shaw) </li>
(Here, the noun clause is a subject complement.)
</ul> 

<h2>A More Sophisticated Definition for "Noun"</h2>

Right, we started with defining a noun as a "naming word," and now we're talking about nouns being clauses functioning as subjects, objects, or complements. As grammarians like to talk about the functions of phrases and clauses, let's summarize this page with a good test for spotting nouns:

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>A Great Test for Nouns<br>(regardless of whether they're single words, phrases, or clauses)</b></center><br>
A noun is any word or group of words that could be replaced with a pronoun.
</div>
</center>

<br><br>

Let's dissect one more example. 

<ul>
<li>A cynic is <u>a man who looks around for a coffin when he smells flowers</u>. (Journalist H L Mencken) </li>
</ul>

The underlined text in the example above is functioning as a noun (a subject complement). As it includes subjects ("who" and "he") and verbs ("looks" and "smells"), you might think it meets the criteria to qualify as a noun clause. It's not though. It's a noun phrase. Those subjects and the verbs feature in the <a href="../glossary/adjective_clauses.htm">adjective clause</a> "who looks around for a coffin when he smells flowers." ("When he smells flowers" is an <a href="../glossary/adverbial_clauses.htm">adverbial clause</a> embedded in the adjective clause.) Hey, if you can follow what's going on in this example, you're well down the path between sentence butcher and sentence surgeon.


<h2>Why Should I Care about Nouns?</h2>

Most native English speakers can form noun phrases and noun clauses without giving the grammar a second thought. So, if the truth be told, understanding how they function isn't particularly useful unless you're required to teach them or to compare them with similar structures in a foreign language you're learning. <br><br>

That said, here are three common issues associated with nouns.
 
<h2>(Issue 1) Only use capital letter with a proper noun.</h2>

Don't give a common noun (e.g., "dog," "brochure," "mountain") a capital letter just because it's an important word in your sentence. Only proper nouns (e.g., "Dexter," "The Summer Brochure," "Ben Nevis") get capital letters.

<ul>
<li>Read the Instructions carefully. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
("Instructions" is a common noun. It doesn't get a capital letter.) 
</ul>


<h2>(Issue 2) Treat a collective noun as singular, but go plural if the context dictates.</h2>

It is normal to treat a collective noun as singular. However, if the context highlights the individuals in the group, you can treat a collective noun as plural.

<ul>
<li>The group <b>arrives</b> before the audience. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
(Here, the verb is "arrives" not "arrive" because "group" is treated as singular.)
<li>The group <b>were</b> out of time. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
(Here, the verb is "were" not "was" because "group" is treated as plural. This might be preferable if the context puts the focus on the group's individuals.)
</ul>

To avoid making a decision on whether to go singular or plural, add a term like "members of" and force the plural.

<ul>
<li><u>The <span class="highlight">members</span> of the group</u> <b>were</b> out of time. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The word "members" becomes the head noun of the new noun phrase.)
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 3) When a noun phrase is the subject of a verb, ensure subject-verb agreement with the head noun.</h2>

<ul>
<li><u>The Spitfire's 9-yard <span class="highlight">belt</span> of bullets</u> <b>give</b> us the term "the full nine yards." <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(The head noun in this noun phrase is "belt." All the other words in the noun phrase are modifiers. As "belt" is singular, the verb "give" is wrong. It should be "gives.") 
 </ul>

Do not be tricked into agreeing the verb with the nearest noun (here, "bullets"). When a noun phrase is the subject of a verb, the head noun governs the verb. <br><br>

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>

<ul>
<li>"I need Water!" <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(It's an important word, but "water" is a common noun, so it doesn't get a capital letter.)
<li>Treat words like "group" (i.e., collective nouns) as singular, but if the focus is on the individuals in the group, go plural.</li>
<li>When a noun phrase is the subject of a verb, don't let the modifiers divert your eye from the head noun as it must govern the verb.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prepositions</h2>
A preposition is a word that usually tells where or when something is in relation to something else.

<h2>Examples of Prepositions that Tell Us Where</h2>
Here are some examples of prepositions that tell us <b>where</b> something is in relation to something else (prepositions highlighted):

<ul>
<li>the boy <span class="highlight">behind</span> the bush</li>
(Here, the preposition "behind" tells us where "the boy" is in relation to "the bush.")
<li>a mouse <span class="highlight">under</span> the stairs</li>
(In this example, the preposition "under" tells us where "a mouse" is in relation to "the stairs.")
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Prepositions that Tell Us When</h2>
Here are some examples of prepositions that tell us <b>when</b> something is in relation to something else (prepositions highlighted):

<ul>
<li>the calm <span class="highlight">before</span> the storm</li>
(Here, the preposition "before" tells us when "the calm" is in relation to "the storm.")
<li>one second <span class="highlight">after</span> the bang</li>
(In this example, the preposition "after" tells us when "one second" is in relation to "the bang.")
</ul>

<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>About the Word "Preposition"</b></center><br><br>
As we've seen, prepositions can tell us where or when something is. However, prepositions are far more versatile than that. The word "preposition" means "positioned before." A preposition sits before a word (either a <a href="nouns.htm">noun</a> or a <a href="pronouns.htm">pronoun</a>) to show that word's relationship to another nearby word. Look at these examples:<br><br>


<ul>
<li>a bone <span class="highlight">for</span> the dog</li>
(Here, the preposition "for" sits before the noun "the dog" to show the relationship between "the dog" and "a bone." This example is not about where or when.)
<li>everyone <span class="highlight">except</span> the teacher</li>
(In this example, the preposition "except" sits before the noun "the teacher" to show the relationship between "the teacher" and "everyone." So, this example is not about where or when either.)
</ul>

<h2>List of Common Prepositions</h2>
Here is a list of common prepositions:<br><br>

<b>above, about, across, against, along, among, around, at, before, behind, below, beneath, beside, between, beyond, by, down, during, except, for, from, in, inside, into, like, near, of, off, on, since, to, toward, through, under, until, up, upon, with, within</b><br>

<h2>Some Easy Examples of Prepositions</h2>
In the examples below, each preposition (highlighted) sits before the noun "the wizard" to show us the relationship between "the wizard" and "the book."

<ul>
<li>The book <span class="highlight">about</span> the wizard</li>
<li>The book <span class="highlight">by</span> the wizard</li>
<li>The book <span class="highlight">near</span> the wizard</li>
<li>The book <span class="highlight">behind</span> the wizard</li>
<li>The book <span class="highlight">under</span> the wizard</li>
</ul>

Here are some more examples: 

<ul>
<li> It is a container <span class="highlight">for</span> butter.</li>
(The preposition "for" shows the relationship between "butter" and "a container.")<br>
<li> The eagle soared <span class="highlight">above</span> the clouds.</li>
(The preposition "above" shows the relationship between "the clouds" and "the eagle.")
<li> He is the President <span class="highlight">of</span> the United States.</li>
(The preposition "of" shows the relationship between "the United States" and "the President.")
</ul>

<h2>The Role of a Preposition</h2>
Prepositions show how two words are linked. Lots of prepositions (e.g., "on," "in," "near," "behind," "under," "inside") tell us <b>where</b> things are relative to each other. For example:

<ul>
<li>The cat sat <span class="highlight">on</span> the mat.</li>
<li>The rat ran <span class="highlight">under</span> the shed.</li>
<li>The Sun dropped <span class="highlight">below</span> the horizon.</li>
</ul>

Often, prepositions (e.g., "during," "after," "before," "in," "on," "at") tell us <b>when</b> things are.

For example:

<ul>
<li>Eat your popcorn <span class="highlight">during</span> the show.</li>
<li>The swans will leave <span class="highlight">in</span> August.</li>
<li>I will clean the windows <span class="highlight">on</span> Sunday.</li>
<li>She said the answer <span class="highlight">before</span> you.</li>
</ul>

Expressing <i>where</i> and <i>when</i> are two key roles for prepositions, but they have other roles too. For example, they might show possession or purpose.

<ul>
<li>These are the wishes <span class="highlight">of</span> the people.</li>
(Here, the preposition "of" shows possession.)
<li>It is a device <span class="highlight">for</span> opening jars.</li>
(Here, the preposition "for" shows purpose.)
</ul>


<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>A Good Way to Think about Prepositions</b></center><br><br>
When you're first learning about prepositions, it might be useful to think about prepositions as <b>anywhere a mouse could go</b>.<br><br>

<center>
<img src="pics/prepositions.jpg" class="resize sidelink" alt="prepositions" /><br><br>
</center>

This works because lots of prepositions show the relationship between two words by expressing their locations relative to each other.
</div>
</center>




<h2>Real-Life Examples of Prepositions</h2>
Here are some real-life sentences featuring prepositions.

<ul>
<li>I cook <span class="highlight">with</span> wine. Sometimes, I even add it <span class="highlight">to</span> food. (Actor W C Fields)</li>
("With" shows the relationship between "wine" and "cook." "To" shows the relationship between "food" and "add it.") 

<li><span class="highlight">Behind</span> every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. (Actor Jim Carrey)</li>
("Behind" shows the relationship between "every great man" and "a woman." The term "every great man" is a <a href="../glossary/noun_phrases.htm">noun phrase</a>. Note that a preposition can sit before a noun, a noun phrase, a <a href="../glossary/noun_clauses.htm">noun clause</a>, or a <a href="pronouns.htm">pronoun</a>.)

<li>The difference <span class="highlight">between</span> stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits. (Physicist Albert Einstein)</li>
("Between" shows the relationship between "stupidity" and "genius.")

<li>If you haven't got anything nice to say <span class="highlight">about</span> anybody, come sit <span class="highlight">next to</span> me. (Writer Alice Roosevelt Longworth)</li>
("About" shows the relationship between "anybody" and "to say." "Next to" shows the relationship between "me" and "sit." Note that a preposition can be more than one word. Other common multi-word prepositions are "close to," "ahead of," "in front of," and "according to.") 
</ul>

<h2>Object of a Preposition</h2>

The word (or phrase) that follows a preposition is called the <a href="../glossary/object_of_a_preposition.htm">object of a preposition</a>. If there is a preposition, there will always be an object of the preposition. A preposition cannot exist by itself.<br><br>

<h2>Prepositional Phrase</h2>

A <a href="../glossary/prepositional_phrase.htm">prepositional phrase</a> is made up of a preposition and the object of the preposition (including any modifiers). Prepositional phrases are very common. They function as either <a href="adjectives.htm">adjectives</a> or <a href="adverbs.htm">adverbs</a>. For example (prepositional phrases highlighted):

<ul>
<li>It is a message <span class="highlight">from Mark</span>.</li>
(Here, the prepositional phrase "from Mark" is functioning like an adjective because it is describing "message.")
<li>Mark is trapped <span class="highlight">on the island</span>.</li>
(Here, the prepositional phrase "on the island" is functioning like an adverb because it is modifying the verb "is trapped.")

<h2>Why Should I Care about Prepositions?</h2>

There are four common issues involving prepositions:

<h2>(Issue 1) Try to avoid ending a sentence in a preposition.</h2>

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>What percentage of people think you can't end a sentence with a preposition?</b></center><br>
Have a look at <a href="prepositions_ending_a_sentence.htm">our poll</a>. It tells us the percentage of people who still think you can't end a sentence with a preposition.
</div>
</center>

<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'pics/preposition_at_end_of_sentence.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>

<br><br>Lots of people think it is incorrect to end a sentence in a preposition because, as we've just covered, a preposition is supposed to sit before a noun. (It is, after all, how preposition gets its name.) Therefore, if the preposition is the last word in the sentence, it can't sit before anything. So, there is some logic to this ruling, which many people follow. However, this issue is far more complicated than many realize, and the best way to summarize it is by saying that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, it's perfectly acceptable - from a grammatical perspective - to end a sentence in a "preposition." (I'll explain the quotation marks later.)<br><br>

Here's the rub. Even though you'd likely be correct by ending your sentence with a "preposition," you should be mindful that a fair few of your readers will think it's a grammar mistake or sloppy writing. As we still haven't trained ourselves to ignore this so-called ruling, we can't ignore it. I like to think of "avoiding a preposition at the end of a sentence" as a game rather than a ruling. Let's look at an example:

<ul>
<li>It is a scenario I have not thought <span class="highlight">of</span>.</li>
(This is natural sounding, but it ends in a preposition.)
</ul>

Let's play the game. Let's restructure our sentence:

<ul>
<li>It is a scenario <span class="highlight">of</span> which I have not thought.</li>
(This sounds awful. It's unnatural and contrived. On the plus side, our preposition now sits before the pronoun "which," and that fits the rule for siting a preposition.)
</ul>

But, it sounds terrible, so let's keep playing. Let's reword our sentence:

<ul>
<li>It is a scenario I have not considered.</li>
(Yes! This sounds natural, and it does not end in a preposition. This keeps everyone happy...except those people who think we shouldn't pander to those who still think you can't end a sentence in a preposition.)
</ul>

So, for now, I'm advising you become a panderer to this non-ruling. I must say this though. If restructuring your sentence makes it sound contrived and you can't reword it, then just let the preposition at the end ride. If you're questioned on it, fight like a dog because you'll be in the right.<br><br>

So, why was "preposition" in quotation marks earlier in this section? Well, quite often, your sentence will end in something that looks like a preposition but isn't. Be mindful that it could be part of a <a href="../glossary/phrasal_verbs.htm">phrasal verb</a>, i.e., a verb made up of a verb and another word (either a preposition or a particle), e.g., "fill in," "stick to," "catch up," "catch out." Quite often, these words must be next to each other, and that's often a factor in your sentence structure.

<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>A Key Point</b></center><br>
The best way to avoid a preposition at the end of a sentence is to choose a non-phrasal verb with the same meaning. This usually leads to a shorter, better-flowing sentence. That's the best reason to avoid a preposition at the end of a sentence.

<ul>
<li>It is a scenario we should not put up with. </li>
(This is sloppy, but it's not technically wrong.)
<li>It is a scenario we should not tolerate. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This is much sharper.)
</ul>

</div>
</center>



<h2>(Issue 2) Don't use the wrong case after a preposition.</h2>

The word or words that follow a preposition are called the object of a preposition. The object of a preposition is always in the <a href="../glossary/objective_case.htm">objective case</a>. This just means that words like "I," "she," "we," and "they" change to "me," "her," "us," and "them" when they follow a preposition (e.g., "about me," "with her," "for us," "against them"). This is a pretty simple concept for a native English speaker, but it still catches some people out. 

<ul>
<li>It is a present <span class="highlight">from</span> my wife and I. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is wrong because "I" cannot be the object of the preposition "from.") 
<li>It is a present <span class="highlight">from</span> me and my wife. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li><span class="highlight">Between</span> you and I <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is wrong because "I" cannot be the object of the preposition "between.") 
<li><span class="highlight">Between</span> you and me <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

Ironically, many people use terms like "from my wife and I" and "between you and I" with a highbrow tone, believing them to be grammatically pure. They're not grammatically pure. They're wrong.<br><br>

Another one that catches people out is using "who" after a preposition. "Who" becomes "whom" in the objective case. In other words, "who" is to "whom" as "he" is to "him" or "they" is to "them." The bottom line is "who" cannot be the object of a preposition. You need "whom.")

<ul>
<li>You went <span class="highlight">with</span> who? <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
<li>You went <span class="highlight">with</span> whom? <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Write "whom" after a preposition.)
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 3) Don't confuse prepositions with other words.</h2>

Writers sometimes confuse prepositions with other words. Here are the most common issues ordered by how frequently they are seen:

<ul>
<li>Writing the adverb "too" (which means overly or as well) instead of the preposition "to" (which has several meanings including towards and for).</li>
</ul>
<a href="../easily_confused/too_to.htm">Read more about "too" and "to</i></a>.

<ul>
<li>Writing the preposition "of" instead of "have" when writing "could've," "should've," or "would've" in full.</li>
</ul>
<a href="should_of_would_of_could_of.htm">Read more about "could've," "would've," and "should've</i></a>.

<ul>
<li>Writing the noun "dependant" (a person, usually a child or spouse) in the multi-word preposition "dependent on" (which means reliant on).</li>
</ul>
<a href="../easily_confused/dependant_dependent.htm">Read more about dependent and dependant</a>.

<ul>
<li>Writing the preposition "past" (beyond) instead of "passed" (past tense of to pass).</li>
</ul>
<a href="../easily_confused/past_passed.htm">Read more about "past" and "passed</i></a>.

<ul>
<li>Writing the preposition "between" (usually used with two distinct points) instead of the preposition "among" (in the middle of a group).</li>
</ul>
<a href="../easily_confused/between_among.htm">Read more about "between" and "among</i></a>.


<h2>(Issue 4) Keep your writing succinct.</h2>

Some <a href="../glossary/phrasal_verbs.htm">phrasal verbs</a> (i.e., multi-word verbs) have prepositions that do not add anything. When you encounter one of these, delete the prepositions to improve succinctness.

<ul>
<li>I cannot face <span class="highlight">up to</span> the consequences.</li>
(This is correct, but it's not succinct.)
<li>I cannot face the consequences.</li>
(This is sharper. The prepositions were a waste of ink.)
</ul>

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can end a sentence in a preposition, but you run the risk of irking people who still think you can't.</li>

<li>Don’t say "between you and I" or "from my wife and I." They're both wrong.</li>

<li>"Too" means overly or as well. "To" doesn't.</li>

<li>Write "have" not "of" when expanding a contraction like "would've."</li>

<li>"Dependent on" means reliant on. A "dependant" is a person.</li>

<h2>Pronouns</h2>

A pronoun is a word that replaces a noun. For example:<br><br>

<center>
<img src="pics/pronouns.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="What are pronouns?"><br>
</center>


<h2>Easy Examples of Pronouns</h2>
In these examples, the nouns being replaced are in bold, and the pronouns are shaded:

<ul>
<li><b>Jack</b> met <b>Jill</b> in Boston. <span class="highlight">He</span> first saw <span class="highlight">her</span> in a Chinese restaurant.</li>
(In this example, the pronoun "he" replaces the noun "Jack," and the pronoun "her" replaces the noun "Jill.")  
</ul>

Another example:

<ul>
<li><b>Visitors</b> descend on <b>New York's Central Park</b>. <span class="highlight">They</span> swarm across <span class="highlight">it</span> like locusts.</li>
(Here, the pronoun "they" replaces the noun "visitors," and the pronoun "it" replaces the <a href="../glossary/noun_phrases.htm">noun phrase</a> "New York's Central Park.")  
</ul>

In the last example, the pronoun "it" replaced a noun phrase ("New York's Central Park") not a single noun. Right then, let's update our definition:

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>Definition for Pronoun</b></center><br>
A pronoun is a word that replaces anything functioning as a noun. This includes:

<ul>
<li><b><a href="nouns.htm">A Noun</a> (a single-word noun)</b>.<br><br>

For example:</li>

	<ul>
	<li>Playful and curious, <b>foxes</b> like to play with balls, and <span class="highlight">they</span> often steal <span class="highlight">them</span> from backyards and golf courses.</li>
	(Here, the pronouns "they" and "them" replace the single-word nouns "foxes" and "balls.") 
	</ul>

<li><b><a href="../glossary/noun_phrases.htm">A Noun Phrase</a> (a multi-word noun)</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li><b>The arctic fox</b> handles the cold better than most animals on Earth. <span class="highlight">It</span> does not feel the cold until the temperature drops to –70°C.</li>
	(Here, the pronoun "it" replaces the noun phrase "the arctic fox.")
	</ul>

<li><b><a href="../glossary/noun_clauses.htm">A Noun Clause</a> (a multi-word noun with its own subject and verb)</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li>We understand <b>why some people dislike foxes</b>. It is because a fox will decimate a chicken coop.</li>
	(Here, the pronoun "it" replaces the noun clause "why people dislike foxes.")
	</ul>

</ul>
</div>
</center>

In normal writing, most nouns appear in noun phrases because adding any word (even "a" or "the") to a noun turns it into a noun phrase. (Noun clauses are far less common.)

<h2>A Video Summary</h2>
Here is a video summarizing this lesson on pronouns.<br><br>
<div class="videoWrapper">

</div>


<h2>Why Do We Need Pronouns?</h2>
Pronouns provide brevity. They prevent us from having to repeat the nouns. Imagine how wearisome a long prose would be if writers had to use the full nouns every time.


<h2>The Antecedent of a Pronoun</h2>
We can't talk about pronouns without mentioning <a href="../glossary/antecedent.htm">antecedents</a>. The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun, noun phrase, or noun clause being replaced by the pronoun.


<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/antecedent_example.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>


<br><br>So, in all the examples above and these next ones, the words in bold are the antecedents of pronouns.

<ul>
<li>Give <b>a girl</b> the right shoes, and <span class="highlight">she</span> can conquer the world. (Actress Marilyn Monroe)</li>
(The pronoun "she" replaces the noun phrase "a girl," which is antecedent of "she.")
</ul>

Here are two more examples:

<ul>
<li><b>Maria</b> loves <b>Saturday</b>. <span class="highlight">It</span> is the day <span class="highlight">she</span> gets her pocket money.</li>
("Saturday" is the antecedent of "it." "Maria" is the antecedent of "she.")
<li><b>The 8-mile walk</b> passes through meadows and woodland. <span class="highlight">It</span> takes in many points of interest including <b>the local airfield</b>, <span class="highlight">which</span> played an important role during World War 2.</li>
("The 8-mile walk" is the antecedent of "it." "The local airfield" is the antecedent of "which." Unlike the others we've encountered so far, "which" isn't a <a href="../glossary/personal_pronouns.htm">personal pronoun</a>. As you will see, the term "pronoun" covers many words, some of which do not fall easily under the description "words that replace nouns.")
</ul>

<h2>Different Types of Pronoun</h2>
For most of us, the pronouns that leap to mind upon hearing "pronoun" are the <a href="../glossary/personal_pronouns.htm">personal pronouns</a> (e.g., "I," "you," "he," "she," "they"), but these are just one type of pronoun.

<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'pics/types_of_pronouns.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>

<br><br>There are nine types:

<table>

<br><br>Let's look at each type of pronoun in turn. (I have also highlighted the key points for writers for each type.)


<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 2em 0em 1em;">(1) Personal Pronouns</h2>

<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/personal_pronouns.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>

<br><br>A personal pronoun takes the place of people or things. The personal pronouns are "I," "you," "he," "she," "it," "we," and "they." 

<ul>
<li><b>Man</b> is what <span class="highlight">he</span> believes. (Russian playwright Anton Chekhov)</li>
("He" takes the place of the noun "man.")

<li>My wife bought <b>some batteries</b>, but <span class="highlight">they</span> weren't included. (Comedian Steven Wright)</li>
("Some batteries" is the antecedent of the pronoun "they.")<br>
(NB: This quotation plays on the idea that batteries are never included when power-powered items are bought.)
</ul>

The personal pronouns above are all <a href="../glossary/subjective_personal_pronouns.htm">subjective personal pronouns</a> because they're the subjects of verbs. There's also the <a href="../glossary/objective_personal_pronoun.htm">objective form of personal pronouns</a> ("me," "him," "her," "us," "them"). The objective form is used when the pronoun is not the subject of a verb (e.g., when it's acted upon or when it follows a <a href="prepositions.htm">preposition</a> like "in" or "near").

<ul>
<li>Get <b>the facts</b> first, then distort <span class="highlight">them</span>. (American author Mark Twain)</li>
<li>Conscience is the only incorruptible thing about <span class="highlight">us</span>. (Henry Fielding)</li>
(Often, the antecedent is not mentioned but understood from context. Here, the antecedent of "us" is the unstated "mankind.")
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Personal Pronouns?</h2>

Native English speakers nearly always use the correct personal pronouns, and there are few serious mistakes associated with them, but here are two noteworthy points.

<h2>(Point 1) The subjective pronoun "I" can't be the object of a verb or the object of a preposition.</h2>

<ul>
<li>They found my wife and <span class="highlight">I</span> under a snowdrift. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(The subjective pronoun "I" must be the subject of a verb. Here, it's the direct object of the verb "found." It should read "They found my wife and me." Of note, however, the term "my wife and me" grates on the ear of most native English speakers, who prefer the word order "me and my wife." This is also a factor in writers opting for "my wife and I," which for many sounds more natural than "my wife and me.")
<li>I sent condolences from my wife and <span class="highlight">I</span>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
<li>Keep this between <span class="highlight">you</span> and <span class="highlight">I</span>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(The term "between you and I" is always wrong.)
</ul>

<h2>(Point 2) This is good stuff for learning a foreign language.</h2>
Knowing personal-pronoun terminology will help with learning a foreign language. If you're a native English speaker, whether you know it or not, you currently select a personal pronoun having first determined its:

<ul>
<li><a href="../glossary/number.htm">Number</a>. Is the personal pronoun representing something singular or plural?</li> 
<li><a href="../glossary/person.htm">Person</a>. Is the personal pronoun representing something in the first person, i.e, the speaker himself or a group that includes the speaker (I, we), the second person, i.e., the speaker's audience (you), or the third person, i.e., everybody else (he, she, it, they)?</li> 
<li><a href="../glossary/gender.htm">Gender</a>. Is the personal pronoun representing something male, female or neuter?</li>
<li><a href="../glossary/case.htm">Case</a>. Is the personal pronoun functioning as a subject or an object?</li>
</ul>

So, when you say something as simple as "We like him," your brain has whipped through that list twice, making eight decisions on personal pronouns. It's flash processing. However, when you start learning a foreign language (particularly in the classroom), this grammar processing is done far more consciously. If you understand our grammar terms, you'll absorb their language "mucho mas rapido." 

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't use a term like "my wife and I" unless it's the subject of a verb.</li>
<li>Never say "between you and I."</li>
</ul>
</div>





<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 2em 0em 1em;">(2) Possessive Pronouns</h2>
 
<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/possessive_pronoun.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>
 
<br><br>A possessive pronoun shows possession. The possessive pronouns are "mine," "yours," "his," "hers," "ours," and "theirs."

<ul>
<li>I always check if the art across the street is better than <span class="highlight">mine</span>. (Artist Andy Warhol)</li>
<li>Humans are the only animals that have children on purpose with the exception of guppies, who like to eat <span class="highlight">theirs</span>. (Satirist P J O'Rourke)</li>
</ul>

Be aware that "my," "your," "his," "her," "its," "our," and "their" (called <a href="../glossary/possessive_adjectives.htm">possessive adjectives</a> in traditional grammar but possessive <a href="../glossary/determiner.htm">determiners</a> in contemporary grammar) can also be classified as pronouns because they too replace nouns. 

<ul>
<li>Is that <b>the Queen's</b> hat? No, it's <span class="highlight">her</span> crown.</li>
("Her" replaces "the Queen." That's why it's classified as a pronoun.)
</ul>


<h2>Why Should I Care about Possessive Pronouns?</h2> 

<h2>Don't put an apostrophe in "yours," "hers," "ours," or "theirs."</h2>
By far the most common mistake related to possessive pronouns is including an apostrophe with "yours," "hers," "ours," or "theirs." There are no apostrophes in any possessive pronouns.

<ul>
<li>There are gods above gods. We have <span class="highlight">ours</span>, and they have <span class="highlight">theirs</span>. That's what's known as infinity. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (French poet Jean Cocteau)</li>
</ul>

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Point</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't put an apostrophe in "yours," "hers," "ours," or "theirs."</li>
</ul>
</div>





<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 2em 0em 1em;">(3) Relative Pronouns</h2> 


<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/relative_pronoun_example.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>


<br><br>A relative pronoun introduces a clause that describes a noun. (The clause is called an <a href="../glossary/adjective_clauses.htm">adjective clause</a>.) The relative pronouns are "that," "which," "who," "whom," and "whose."

The following relative pronouns introduce adjective clauses (underlined) that provide information necessary to identify their nouns. (Note that there are no commas.)

<ul>
<li>Education is the most powerful weapon <u><span class="highlight">which</span> you can use to change the world</u>. (President of South Africa Nelson Mandela)</li>
<li>An atheist is a man <u><span class="highlight">who</span> has no invisible means of support</u>. (Canadian politician John Buchan)</li>
</ul>

The following relative pronouns introduce adjective clauses that give unnecessary but interesting information about their nouns. (Note that there are commas.)

<ul>
<li>The United Nations, <u><span class="highlight">whose</span> membership comprises almost all the states in the world</u>, is founded on the principle of the equal worth of every human being. (UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan)</li>
<li>The man Dickens, <u><span class="highlight">whom</span> the world at large thought it knew</u>, stood for all the Victorian virtues even as his novels exposed the greed and cruelty of the Victorian age. (Author Robert Gottlieb)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Relative Pronouns?</h2>

Here are the top five questions related to relative pronouns:

<h2>(Question 1) Do you put a comma before "which" or "who"?</h2>
The answer is sometimes yes and sometimes no. This applies to all relative pronouns, not just "which" and "who." (Actually, it doesn't apply to "that," but we'll cover "that" later.) Look at these two examples using "who":

<ul>
<li>The man <u><span class="highlight">who</span> won last week’s lottery</u> gave all his money to a donkey sanctuary. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li>My neighbour, <u><span class="highlight">who</span> won last week’s lottery</u>, gave all his money to a donkey sanctuary. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

These two sentences are nearly identical, but one has commas and one doesn’t. It all depends whether the adjective clause (the underlined text) specifies its noun. If it does (like in the first example, where it specifies "the man"), then don’t use commas. If it doesn’t (like in the second example, where it’s just additional information about "my neighbour"), then use commas. Now look at this example:

<ul>
<li>My neighbour <u><span class="highlight">who</span> won last week’s</u> lottery gave all his money to a donkey sanctuary. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

This is also correct. This time the adjective clause is specifying "my neighbour." We’re now talking about my lottery-winning neighbour as opposed to any neighbours who didn’t win the lottery. So, you have to think carefully about whether an adjective clause specifies or doesn’t.

<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>Good Tip</b></center><br>
Treat the commas like brackets. If you’d happily put brackets around the adjective clause, then use commas because the clause will just be additional information. (Similarly, if you'd happily delete the clause, then it must be just additional information.)
</div>
</center>

"That" is different. Lots of Americans, and increasingly Brits, insist on using "that" instead of "which" without a comma (i.e., when "which" heads an adjective clause that specifies its noun). Look at these examples:

<ul>
<li>The dog <u><span class="highlight">which</span> bit the postman</u> has returned. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (but Americans would dislike it)</li>
<li>The dog <u><span class="highlight">that</span> bit the postman</u> has returned. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (for everybody)</li>
</ul>

Both are correct, but some find the top one a little awkward. (When a clause specifies its noun, it's called a <a href="../glossary/restrictive_clause.htm">restrictive clause</a>. When it’s just additional information, it’s called a <a href="../glossary/non-restrictive_clauses.htm">non-restrictive clause</a>.)<br><br>

So, "which" can head a restrictive adjective clause (without commas) or a non-restrictive one (with commas), but, if you’re in the US, use "that" for the former. 

<ul>
<li>My dog gives a trust <u><span class="highlight">which</span> / <span class="highlight">that</span> is total</u>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Both options work for a restrictive adjective clause, but Americans will hate "which" being used.)
<li>My dog gives total trust, <u><span class="highlight">which</span> / <strike><span class="highlight">that</span></strike> is very endearing</u>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Only "which" works with a non-restrictive adjective clause.)
</ul>

Had the question been "Do you put a comma before that?", the answer would've been quick. No.

<ul>
<li>How can you govern a country <u><span class="highlight">which</span> has 246 varieties of cheese</u>?  <img src="../images/tick.png"/>(Charles De Gaulle)</li>
(This translation of De Gaulle's quotation is fine, but for many "that" would've read better.)
</ul>
 
Here's a real-life example:

<ul>
<li>War should only be declared by the authority of the people, <u><span class="highlight">whose</span> toils and treasures are to support its burdens</u>, instead of the government <u><span class="highlight">which</span> is to reap its fruits</u>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (US President Madison)</li>
(The first adjective clause is non-restrictive (just "additional information" about the people). The second is restrictive (specifies the government). Get it?) 
</ul>

Using a comma before a word like "which" is not an aesthetics thing. It's not a fly-by-the-seat-of-your pants thing. It's a depends-on-the-intended-meaning thing.

<h2>(Question 2) Can you use "whose" for inanimate things?</h2>
Yes. "Who" is used for people. "Which" is used for things. "Whose" is used for people and things.

<ul>
<li>Never go to a doctor <u><span class="highlight">whose</span> office plants have died</u>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Author Erma Bombeck)</li>
("Whose" has been used with a person. That's normal.)
<li>An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea <u><span class="highlight">whose</span> time has come</u>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (French poet Victor Hugo)</li>
("Whose" has been used with something inanimate ("idea"). That's acceptable.)
</ul>

<h2>(Question 3) When do you use "whom"?</h2>
Here's the rule: Use "who" when it’s the subject of verb (the verb is shown in bold), otherwise use "whom."

<ul>
<li>Never lend your car to anyone <u><span class="highlight">who</span> <b>calls</b> you mum</u>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
("Who" is the subject of the verb "calls.")
<li>Never lend your car to anyone <u><span class="highlight">whom</span> you <b>have given birth to</b></u>.  <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Author Erma Bombeck)</li>
("Whom" is not the subject of a verb. "You" is.)
</ul>

Many consider "whom" to be an obsolete word. So, if you're unsure whether to use "who" or "whom," use "who."

<h2>(Question 4) Can you use "that" for people?</h2>
"That," like "whose," can be used for people or things. 

<ul>
<li>The dog <u><span class="highlight">that</span> bit the postman</u>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> </li>
<li>The postman <u><span class="highlight">that</span> bit the dog</u>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/>(but not popular)</li>
</ul>

Try to use "who" instead of "that" with people (especially in formal writing). Some of your readers might find "that" with people a little uncouth.

<h2>(Question 5) What's the difference between "whose" and "who's"?</h2>
"Who's" is a contraction. It is short for "who is" or "who has." If you can't expand your "who's" to one of those, then use "whose." 

<ul>
<li>A weed is a plant <u><span class="highlight">who's</span> virtues have never been discovered</u>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (should be "whose")
</ul>

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Point</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you'd happily put your adjective clause in brackets, then it doesn't specify its noun. Offset it with commas.</li>
</ul>
</div>





<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 2em 0em 1em;">(4) Demonstrative Pronouns</h2>
 
<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/demonstrative_pronouns.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>

 
<br><br>The demonstrative pronouns are "this," "that," "these," and "those." A demonstrative pronoun can refer to something previously mentioned or to something in the speaker's surroundings (e.g., something being pointed at by the speaker). 

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Those</span> are my principles, and if you don't like them...well, I have others. (Groucho Marx)
<li>Some people get so rich they lose all respect for humanity. <span class="highlight">That</span> is how rich I want to be. (Comedian Rita Rudner)
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Demonstrative Pronouns?</h2>

When using a demonstrative pronoun, make sure your link to its <a href="../glossary/antecedent.htm">antecedent</a> is obvious.

Typically in writing, the antecedent of a demonstrative pronoun is close by in the previous text. In these two examples, the links to the antecedents (shown in bold) are not ambiguous. 

<ul>
<li><b>My court case</b> isn't a trial. <span class="highlight">This</span> is a lynching. (Pathologist Jack Kevorkian)</li>
<li><b>Liberty means responsibility</b>. <span class="highlight">That</span> is why most men dread it. (Playwright George Bernard Shaw)</li>
(The whole previous sentence, i.e., the idea, is the antecedent of That.)
</ul>

You must ensure your demonstrative pronoun's antecedent is clear. Let's imagine George Bernard Shaw had written this instead:

<ul>
<li>Liberty means responsibility. <span class="highlight">That</span> is what most men dread.  <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (ambiguous)</li>
(Is the antecedent of "that" the whole idea as before? It's now less clear because the antecedent could be "liberty" or "responsibility.")  
</ul>

Here's another example with an ambiguous antecedent:

<ul>
<li>The next intake of recruits will receive four presentations on the new procedures. <span class="highlight">These</span> are scheduled to start in mid-August. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (ambiguous)</li>
(The antecedent of "these" is ambiguous. It could be "the recruits," "the presentations," or "the procedures.")
</ul>

Such ambiguity occurs because a writer knows what the antecedent is and assumes others will spot it with the same clarity. (Unfortunately though, that clarity doesn't always shine through the words.) Ambiguity most often occurs when a writer has expressed a multi-component idea and then starts a sentence with a term like "This means…," "This explains…," or "This is why…."<br><br>

If you find yourself starting a sentence this way, ask yourself a question like "What means?," "What explains?," or "What is why?." If the answer doesn’t leap out at you, you should consider a rewrite or a demonstrative determiner and a noun to spell it out more clearly. 

<ul>
<li>The next intake of recruits will receive four presentations on the new procedures. <b>These presentations</b> are scheduled to start in mid-August. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (clearer)</li>
(Using "These presentations" (a demonstrative determiner and a noun) makes it clear what "These" refers to.) 
</ul>

<br><br>An emphatic pronoun is paired with another noun or pronoun (shown in bold) to emphasize it. The emphatic pronouns are "myself," "yourself," "herself," "himself," "itself," "ourselves," "yourselves," and "themselves." 

<ul>
<li><b>The Queen</b> <span class="highlight">herself</span> attended the party.</li>
("The Queen" is the noun being emphasized. "The Queen" is the antecedent of "herself.")
<li>Nothing is impossible for <b>the man</b> who doesn't have to do it <span class="highlight">himself</span>. ("Weiler's Law")</li>
<li>Learn from others' mistakes. <b>You</b> won't live long enough to make them all <span class="highlight">yourself</span>. (Anon)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Emphatic Pronouns?</h2>

Using an emphatic pronoun is far slicker than <b>bolding a word</b>, WRITING IT IN UPPERCASE LETTERS, or <u>underlining it</u>. Yuk! When speaking, you can emphasize a word with your voice, so there's an alternative to using an emphatic pronoun. In writing, however, the alternatives are often unwieldy or ambiguous.<br><br> 

An emphatic pronoun just provides emphasis, but that's a pretty important job. It's often the reason the sentence exists.

<ul>
<li><b>She</b> will attend the reception drinks <span class="highlight">herself</span>.</li>
</ul>

Note than an emphatic pronoun can be removed from a sentence without affecting the sentence's core meaning.

<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/reflexive_pronoun.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>

 
<br><br>A reflexive pronoun is paired with another noun or pronoun to show it is acting on itself. They have a different function to emphatic pronouns, but they're the same words ("myself," "yourself," "herself," "himself," "itself," "ourselves," "yourselves," and "themselves"). In these examples, the subject (in bold) is the antecedent of the reflexive pronoun.

<ul>
<li><b>Alison</b> does not trust <span class="highlight">herself</span>.</li>
<li><b>I</b> often quote <span class="highlight">myself</span>. It adds spice to my conversation. (Playwright George Bernard Shaw)</li>
<li>If <b>the world</b> blew <span class="highlight">itself</span> up, the last voice would an expert's saying it's impossible. (Actor Peter Ustinov)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Reflexive Pronouns?</h2>

"You" can't do something to "myself"; only "I" can. The most common mistake involving reflexive pronouns is using one when the subject of the verb is not doing something to itself. (In these examples, the subjects, which are also the antecedents of the reflexive pronouns) are shown in bold.)

<ul>
<li><b>He</b> did it to <span class="highlight">myself</span>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>	
<li><b>I</b> did it to <span class="highlight">myself</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li><b>He</b> did it to <span class="highlight">himself</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

Most often, writers make this mistake because they think "myself" sounds more formal than "me." 

<ul>
<li><b>He</b> insulted the doctor and <span class="highlight">myself</span>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li> 
<li>Please pass any comments to the director or <span class="highlight">myself</span>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> </li>
(This example has the implied subject "you", i.e., "Please [will you] pass any comments…". See also <a href="../glossary/imperative_sentence.htm">imperative sentence</a>.) 
</ul>

Here are better versions:

<ul>
<li>He insulted me and the doctor. </li> 
<li>Please pass any comments to me or the director. </li> 
(Note how "me" now comes first. If it didn't, these sentences would sound awkward, and that also contributes to writers going for "myself.")
</ul>

Here's the issue. The antecedent of "myself" is always "I." If "I" isn't doing something to "myself," then "myself" is wrong. Ironically, lots of people who mistakenly use "myself," "yourself," etc. do so believing a reflexive pronoun sounds more highbrow than the correct personal pronoun ("me," "you," etc.).<br><br> 

Oh, and don't write "hisself"...ever. It's "himself." 


<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 30px;">

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 2em 0em 1em;">(7) Indefinite Pronouns</h2>

<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/indefinite_pronoun.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>

 
<br><br>An indefinite pronoun refers to a person or a thing without being specific. The most common indefinite pronouns are "any," "anyone," "anything," "each," "everybody," "everyone," "everything," "few," "many," "no one," "nobody," "none," "several," "some," "somebody," and "someone."

<ul>
<li>A classic is <span class="highlight">something</span> that <span class="highlight">everybody</span> wants to have read and <span class="highlight">nobody</span> wants to read. (Writer Mark Twain)</li>
<li>I don't know <span class="highlight">anything</span> about music. In my line, you don't have to. (Singer Elvis Presley)</li>
</ul>

Do not confuse indefinite pronouns with indefinite determiners (also called quantifiers or, in traditional grammar, <a href="../glossary/indefinite_adjectives.htm">indefinite adjectives</a>). Here's the difference: An indefinite pronoun stands alone. An indefinite determiner modifies a noun or a pronoun. Here are some examples with indefinite determiners (bold) and indefinite pronouns (shaded). 

<ul>
<li><b>Some</b> people have so <b>much</b> respect for their superiors they have <span class="highlight">none</span> left for themselves. (Playwright George Bernard Shaw)</li>
<li><b>Each</b> <span class="highlight">one</span> of us alone is worth <span class="highlight">nothing</span>. (Revolutionary Che Guevara)</li>
(Indefinite determiners can even modify indefinite pronouns.)
</ul>

<h2>More about Indefinite Pronouns</h2>

Indefinite pronouns can be singular or plural. Here's a list:

<ul>
<li><b>Always Singular</b>. another, anybody, anyone, anything, each, either, enough, everybody, everyone, everything, less, little, much, neither, nobody, no one, nothing, one, other, somebody, someone, and something.</li>
<li><b>Always Plural</b>. both, few, fewer, many, others, and several.</li>
<li><b>Singular or Plural</b>. all, any, more, most, none, some, and such.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Indefinite Pronouns?</h2>

There are four common issues related to indefinite pronouns.
  
<h2>(Issue 1) "None" can be singular or plural.</h2>
Your retiring English teacher might tell you that "none" is always singular, but that's outdated. "None" can be singular or plural. 

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">None</span> of the students <b>is</b> expected to get an A. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li><span class="highlight">None</span> of the students <b>are</b> expected to get As or Bs. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
</ul>

If your "none" best translates as "not one of," go singular. If it best translates "not any of," go plural. That's the usual advice given, but it's not great because "not any of" sounds awkward, which steers writers away from going plural with "none." Here's some more-useful advice. Follow your instincts, but, if you're still unsure, go singular.<br><br> 

There's another factor. If you find yourself treating "none" as singular with a singular "they" or "their" (see Issue 4), go plural throughout.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">None</span> of the students <b>has</b> done <b>their</b> homework. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (untidy)</li>
("None" is singular (hence "has"). Using "their" is acceptable, but it's untidy.)
<li><span class="highlight">None</span> of the students <b>have</b> done <b>their</b> homework. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (tidy)</li>
("None" is plural (hence "have"). Using "their" is natural. This is tidy.)
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 2) "Either" and "neither" are singular.</h2>
Even though the pronouns "either" and "neither" naturally refer to two things, treat them as singular.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Either</span> of the brothers <b>are</b> welcome to attend. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
("Either" is singular. It should be "is welcome to attend.")
<li>Men's anger about religion is like two men quarrelling over a lady <span class="highlight">neither</span> of them <b>care</b> for. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (1st Earl of Halifax Edward Wood)</li>
("Neither" is singular. It should be "neither of them cares for.")
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 3) Some indefinite pronouns (e.g., "all," "some") can be singular or plural.</h2>
The indefinite pronouns "all," "any," "more," "most," and "some" are singular when they refer to something singular but plural when they refer to something plural.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">More</span> of them <b>were</b> needed. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
("Them" is plural; therefore, "were" is correct.)
<li><span class="highlight">More</span> of it <b>was</b> needed. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
("It" is singular; therefore, "was" is correct.)
</ul>

This point gets a little more complicated when the indefinite pronoun is used with a <a href="../glossary/collective_nouns.htm">collective noun</a> (e.g., "crowd," "team").

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Most</span> of the crowd <b>is</b> leaving. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li><span class="highlight">Most</span> of the crowd <b>are</b> waving <b>their</b> national flags. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

When used with a <a href="../glossary/collective_nouns.htm">collective noun</a>, an indefinite pronoun is singular if you envisage it representing a single body but plural if you envisage it representing individuals. 

<h2>(Issue 4) Words like "someone" and "anyone" (i.e., singular indefinite pronouns that represent people) are gender neutral, but it's not always easy to keep that neutrality.</h2>
The singular indefinite pronouns that represent people (e.g., "anyone," "each," "everyone," "no one," "nobody," "someone") are gender neutral. However, many other singular pronouns used for people (e.g., "his," "her," "he," "she") aren't gender neutral. We have the gender neutral "it" and "its," but they're not used for people. It's a gap in English grammar, and it can cause problems. 

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">No one</span> knows what <b>he</b> can do till <b>he</b> tries. (Latin writer Publilius Syrus)</li>
(Why he? This also applies to women.)
<li>From <span class="highlight">each</span> according to <b>his</b> abilities, to <span class="highlight">each</span> according to <b>his</b> needs. (Revolutionary Karl Marx)</li>
(Why his?)
</ul>

This problem is easy to fix. There are two good options:<br><br>

<b>(Option 1) Reword and go "all plural."</b>

<ul>
<li>People don't know what <b>they</b> can do till <b>they</b> try. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

<b>(Option 2) Treat "they" and "their" as singular. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></b> 

<ul>
<li>From <span class="highlight">each</span> according to <b>their</b> abilities, to <span class="highlight">each</span> according to <b>their</b> needs. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (acceptable)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 2em 0em 1em;">(8) Interrogative Pronouns</h2>

<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/interrogative_pronouns.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>

 
<br><br>An interrogative pronoun is used to ask a question. The interrogative pronouns are "what," "which," "who," "whom," and "whose." 

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Which</span> is worse, failing or never trying?</li>
<li><span class="highlight">What</span> is originality? Undetected plagiarism. (Dean of St Paul's Cathedral William Inge)</li>
</ul>

The other, less common interrogative pronouns are the same as the ones above but with the suffix "-ever" or "-soever" (e.g., "whatever," "whichever," "whatsoever," "whichsoever"). They're used for emphasis or to show surprise.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Whatever</span> did you say?</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Whomsoever</span> did you find?</li>
</ul>

The antecedent of an interrogative pronoun is the answer to the question.<br><br>

Interrogative pronouns can also be used to create <a href="../glossary/indirect_questions.htm">indirect questions</a> (underlined).

<ul>
<li>Do you know <u><span class="highlight">what</span> this is</u>?</li>
(The interrogative pronoun "what" heads an indirect question in a question.)
<li>I want to know <u><span class="highlight">what</span> this is</u>.</li>
(Here, "what" heads an indirect question in a statement.)
</ul>

Do not confuse interrogative pronouns with interrogative determiners (called <a href="../glossary/interrogative_adjectives.htm">interrogative adjectives</a> in traditional grammar), which look the same as interrogative pronouns. 

<ul>
<li><b>Which</b> feat is the greater?</li>
(This is not an interrogative pronoun. It's an interrogative determiner. The word "Which" modifies "feat." Therefore, it's a determiner.)
</ul>

Also, do not confuse interrogative pronouns with <a href="../glossary/interrogative_adverbs.htm">interrogative adverbs</a> ("how," "when," "why," "where"), which are also used to ask questions. Interrogative adverbs ask about the time, place, reason, or manner an action occurs. (In these examples, the action, i.e., the verb, is shown in bold.)

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">When</span> <b>will</b> the game <b>start</b>? </li>
<li><span class="highlight">Why</span> <b>is</b> common sense seldom common practice? (Eliyahu Goldratt)</li>
</ul>

"How" is also used to ask about amounts, quantities, and degrees.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">How</span> much coke <b>have</b> you <b>got</b>?</li>
<li><span class="highlight">How</span> many skittles <b>have</b> you <b>eaten</b>?</li>
</ul>

Let's unpick this example:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Who</span> are you and <b>how</b> did you get in here? </li>
<li>I'm a locksmith. And...I'm a locksmith. (from the TV series "Police Squad!")</li>
(The answer to the interrogative pronoun "who" is the noun phrase "a locksmith." The answer to the interrogative adverb "how" is the, albeit unstated, adverbial phrase "by virtue of being a locksmith." The answer to a question starting with an interrogative pronoun will be a noun, typically a person, place, or thing. The answer to an interrogative adverb will be an adverb, typically words that specify a time, place, reason, or manner.)
</ul>

Interrogative determiners and adverbs have been included here because they too have antecedents (the answers to the questions they ask). Like some other determiners, that makes them pretty pronouny (or pronominal, as they say).

<h2>Why Should I Care about Interrogative Pronouns?</h2>

Mistakes involving interrogatives (pronouns, determiners or adverbs) are rare, but here are two reasons to think about them.

<h2>(Reason 1) Punctuating sentences correctly.</h2>
Only questions get question marks. It sounds obvious, but it's not uncommon for writers to use a question mark at the end of a non-question featuring an indirect question (underlined).

<ul>
<li>Please tell me <u><span class="highlight">who</span> told you</u>? <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is not a question. It's a statement. It should end in a period (full stop).)
</ul>

Before using a question mark, make sure the sentence is a question.

<ul>
<li>Can you tell me <u><span class="highlight">who</span> told you</u>? <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

<h2>(Reason 2) Creating rhetorical questions.</h2>
Interrogatives can be used to ask a <a href="../glossary/rhetorical_questions.htm">rhetorical question</a> (a question for which no answer is expected). Posing a rhetorical question is an efficient and engaging way of making a point or introducing a new idea.

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">What</span> is a weed? A weed is a plant whose virtues have never been discovered. (American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson)
</ul>

Rhetorical questions are also useful for making a point in a non-antagonistic or diplomatic way.

<ul>
<li>Do Europe's royal families pay their way?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin: 2em 0em 1em;">(9) Reciprocal Pronouns</h2>

<center><div style="margin-top: 2em;"><span class="cursq4 infographic" onClick = "showInfographic(this,'../glossary/pics/reciprocal_pronouns.png')">Show me an infographic</span></div></center>

 
<br><br>A reciprocal pronoun is used to express a mutual action or relationship. The reciprocal pronouns are "each other" and "one another."

<ul>
<li>When <b>two people</b> are like <span class="highlight">each other</span>, <b>they</b> tend to like <span class="highlight">each other</span>. (Author Tony Robbins)
<li><b>Gentlemen</b> don't read <span class="highlight">each other's</span> mail. (US Secretary of War Henry Stimson)
<li><b>Laws</b>, like houses, lean on <span class="highlight">one another</span>. (Statesman Edmund Burke)
</ul>


<h2>Why Should I Care about Reciprocal Pronouns?</h2>

There are two common questions related to reciprocal pronouns?

<h2>(Question 1) Do you write "each others'" or "each other's?"</h2>
Write "each other's" and "one another's." (In other words, put the apostrophe before the "s" when you need the possessive form.)

<ul>
<li><b>We</b> drink <span class="highlight">one another's</span> healths and spoil our own. (Author Jerome K Jerome)</li>
</ul>

Even though a reciprocal pronoun refers to two or more things, the possessive form is created by adding "'s" (i.e., like for the possessive form of a singular noun). Some writers, sensing the plurality of a reciprocal pronoun, feel an urge to place the apostrophe after the "s" (i.e., like for the possessive form of a plural noun). Whatever. The apostrophe goes before the "s."

<h2>(Question 2) What's the difference between "each other" and "one another"?</h2>
When the antecedent of a reciprocal pronoun is two things, use "each other." When it's more than two things, use "one another."

<ul>
<li><b>My dog and cat</b> love <span class="highlight">each other</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li><b>My dog, cat, and emu</b> love <span class="highlight">one another</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

Under this ruling, the following quotation is wrong:

<ul>
<li>I think <b>a couple</b> should complete <span class="highlight">one another</span>, not compete with <span class="highlight">one another</span>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/> (Singer Marie Osmond)</li>
 </ul>

It's a little more complicated than that because it depends on what the writer had in mind:

<ul>
<li><b>Friends</b> are kind to <span class="highlight">one another's</span> dreams. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (for lots of friends)</li>
<li><b>Friends</b> are kind to <span class="highlight">each other's</span> dreams. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (for two friends)</li>
<li><b>Old and young</b> disbelieve <span class="highlight">one another's</span> truths. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Aphorist Mason Cooley)</li>
("Each other" could be justified if you think of two discrete groups and not lots of individuals.)
</ul>

If you're picked up for writing "each other" instead of "one another," you might be able to defend your "each other" by claiming you had two people (or things) in mind. If you're picked up for writing "one another" with an antecedent of two, you're toast. Moreover, if you're picked up for either, you're dealing with a grammar pedant.

<h2>Verbs</h2>

What are verbs?<br><br>

A verb is a word that expresses:

<ul>
<li> A physical action (e.g., "to swim," "to write," "to climb").</li>
<li> A mental action (e.g., "to think," "to guess," "to consider").</li>
<li> A state of being (e.g., "to be," "to exist," "to appear").</li>
</ul>

You might find it useful to think of verbs as "doing" words. 


<h2>Verbs Expressing Physical Actions</h2>
Here are some sentences with verbs that express physical actions. (In each example, the verb is in bold.)

<ul>
<li> She <b>sells</b> pegs and lucky heather.</li>
(In this example, the word "sells" is a verb. It expresses the physical activity "to sell.")
<li> The doctor <b>wrote</b> the prescription.</li>
(In this example, the word "wrote" is a verb. It expresses the physical activity "to write.")
<li> Alison <b>bought</b> a ticket.</li>
(The word "bought" is a verb. It expresses the physical activity "to buy.")
</ul>

<h2>Verbs Expressing Mental Actions</h2>
While many verbs express physical actions (e.g., "to jump," "to dance," "to sing"), verbs can also express mental actions. For example:

<ul>

<li> She <b>considers</b> the job done.</li>
(The word "considers" is a verb. It expresses the mental activity "to consider.")

<li> Peter <b>guessed</b> the right number.</li>
(The word "guessed" is a verb. It expresses the mental activity "to guess.")

<li> I <b>thought</b> the same thing.</li>
(The word "thought" is a verb. It expresses the mental activity "to think.")
</ul>

<h2>Verbs Expressing a State of Being</h2>
A small but extremely important group of verbs do not express any activity at all; they express a state of being. The most important verb in this group (arguably of all) is the verb "to be."<br><br> 

Here is the verb "to be" in the different <a href="../glossary/tense.htm">tenses</a>:<br>

<table>
<tr><th rowspan="2">Subject</th><th colspan="3">Verb "to be"</tr>

<th>past tense</th>
<th>present tense</th>
<th>future tense</th>  
</tr>
<tr><td>I</td>
<td>was</td>
<td>am</td>
<td>will be</td>  
</tr>
<tr><td>You</td>
<td>were</td>
<td>are</td>
<td>will be</td>  
</tr>
<tr><td>He / She / It</td>
<td>was</td>
<td>is</td>
<td>will be</td>  
</tr>
<tr><td>We</td>
<td>were</td>
<td>are</td>
<td>will be</td>  
</tr>
<tr><td>You</td>
<td>were</td>
<td>are</td>
<td>will be</td>  
</tr>
<tr><td>They</td>
<td>were</td>
<td>are</td>
<td>will be</td>  
</tr></table>
<br>

Here are some real examples with the verb "to be":

<h2>The Types of Verbs</h2>
As we've covered, a verb can be categorized as a physical verb (e.g., to run), a mental verb (e.g., to think), or a state-of-being verb (e.g., to be). However, a verb will often be further categorized as one of the following:

<h2>Action Verb</h2>
An action verb expresses an activity that a person or thing can do. For example: 

<ul>
<li> Lee <b>eats</b> cake. </li>
("Eating" is something Lee can do.) 
<li> The bear <b>chased</b> the salmon in the shallow rapids. </li>
("Chasing" is something the bear can do.)
</ul>

Compare those verbs with these:

<ul>
<li> Lee <b>likes</b> cake. </li>
("To like" is not an activity. It's a state.) 
<li> The bear <b>is</b> hungry. </li>
("To be" is not an activity. It's a state.)
</ul>

<h2>Stative Verb</h2>
A stative verb expresses a state rather than an action. A stative verb typically relates to a state of being, a thought, or an emotion. For example: 

<ul>
<li> I <b>am</b> at home. </li>
<li> She <b>believes</b> in fairies. </li>
<li> He <b>feels</b> elated.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transitive Verb</h2>
A transitive verb is one that acts on something (i.e., it has a <a href="../glossary/direct_object.htm">direct object</a>). For example: 

<ul>
<li> I <b>saw</b> the dog. </li>
(Here, the direct object is "the dog.")
<li> Lee <b>ate</b> the pie. </li>
(Here, the direct object is "the pie.")
<li> The postman <b>will give</b> Sarah the letter.</li>
(Here, the direct object is "the letter.")
</ul>

Note: The direct object of a transitive verb can be found by finding the verb and asking "what?" For example, "saw what?" (answer: the dog); "ate what?" (answer: the pie); "will give what?" (answer: the letter).<br><br>

<a href="../glossary/transitive_verbs.htm">Read more about transitive verbs</a>.

<h2>Intransitive Verb</h2>
An intransitive verb is one that does not act on something (i.e., there is no direct object). For example: 

<ul>
<li> The rain <b>fell</b>.</li>
<li> My throat <b>hurts</b>.</li>
<li> The cat <b>sneezed</b>.</li>
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/intransitive_verbs.htm">Read more about intransitive verbs</a>.
<h2>Auxiliary Verb</h2>
An auxiliary verb (or <a href="../glossary/helping_verb.htm">helping verb</a>) accompanies a main verb to help express <a href="../glossary/tense.htm">tense</a>, <a href="../glossary/voice.htm">voice</a> or <a href="../glossary/mood.htm">mood</a>. The most common auxiliary verbs are "be," "do," and "have" (in their various forms). Here are some examples of auxiliary verbs:
 
<ul>
<li> Lee <b>has</b> eaten all the pies. </li>
(Here, the auxiliary verb "has" helps to express <a href="../glossary/tense.htm">tense</a>.) 

<li> The table <b>has been</b> prepared. </li>
(Here, the auxiliary verbs "has been" help to express <a href="../glossary/voice.htm">voice</a> (in this case, the <a href="../glossary/passive_voice.htm">passive voice</a>).)

<li>If he <b>were</b> to arrive in the next 10 minutes, we <b>would</b> be on schedule.</li> 
(Here, the auxiliary verbs "were" and "would" help to express <a href="../glossary/voice.htm">mood</a> (in this case, the <a href="../glossary/subjunctive_mood.htm">subjunctive mood</a>).)

</ul>

<a href="../glossary/auxiliary_verbs.htm">Read more about auxiliary verbs</a>.

<h2>Modal Verb</h2>
A modal verb is a type of auxiliary verb used to express ideas such as ability, possibility, permission, and obligation. The modal auxiliary verbs are "can," "could," "may," "might," "must," "ought to," "shall," "should," "will," and "would." For example:

<ul>
<li> Lee <b>can</b> eat a lot of pies.</li> 
(Here, the modal verb "can" helps to express the idea of ability.) 
<li> Lee <b>might</b> eat that pie before he gets home.</li> 
(Here, the modal verb "might" helps to express the idea of possibility.) 
<li> Lee <b>may</b> eat as many pies as he likes.</li> 
(Here, the modal verb "may" helps to express the idea of permission.) 
<li> Lee <b>should</b> give you some of that pie given you bought it.</li> 
(Here, the modal verb "should" helps to express the idea of obligation.) 
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/auxiliary_verbs.htm">Read more about auxiliary modal verbs</a>.

<h2>Phrasal Verb</h2>
A phrasal verb is a verb made up of more than one word (usually two words). A phrasal verb has a main verb and another word (either a <a href="prepositions.htm">preposition</a> or a particle). The phrasal verb usually has a meaning different to the main verb. For example:

<ul>
<li> A burglar will often break a window to <b>break in</b>.</li> 
(Here, the phrasal verb "break in" means "to enter illegally," which is different to "break.") 
<li> If you drop the baton the team will <b>drop back</b> to last place.</li> 
(Here, the phrasal verb "drop back" means "to fall behind," which is different to "drop.") 
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/phrasal_verbs.htm">Read more about phrasal verbs</a>.

<h2>Regular and Irregular Verbs</h2>
A <a href="../glossary/regular_verbs.htm">regular verb</a> is one that forms its <a href="../glossary/simple_past_tense.htm">simple past tense</a> and its <a href="../glossary/past_participles.htm">past participle</a> by adding <b>-ed</b> or <b>-d</b> to the <a href="../glossary/base_form.htm">base form</a> of the verb. (Note: There are spelling rules to consider too.) For example:<br>

<table class="gridtable">
<tr>
<th>Regular Verb</th><th>Simple Past Tense</th><th>Past Participle</th></tr>

<tr><td>love</td><td>loved</td><td>has loved</td></tr>
<tr><td>hate</td><td>hated</td><td>has hated</td></tr>
<tr><td>move</td><td>moved</td><td>has moved</td></tr>
</table><br>

An irregular verb is one that does not conform to this ruling. For example: <br>

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>Irregular Verb</th><th>Simple Past Tense</th><th>Past Participle</th></tr>
<tr><td>tell</td><td>told</td><td>has told</td></tr>
<tr><td>bleed</td><td>bled</td><td>has bled</td></tr>
</table><br>

<h2>Verb Terminology</h2>

There is a lot of grammatical terminology associated with verbs. Below are explanations of the most common terms. (There is a more comprehensive list in our <a href="../grammar_terms_and_definitions.htm">Glossary of
Terms</a>.)

<h2>The Infinitive Form</h2>

When a verb is preceded by the word "to," it is said to be in its <a href="../glossary/infinitive_form.htm">infinitive form</a> (i.e., its most basic form).

<ul>
<li> I have to smoke that!</li>
("To smoke" is the infinitive form of the verb.)
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/infinitive_form.htm">Read more about the infinitive form of a verb</a>.


<h2>Past Tense</h2>

Verbs that express actions in the past are said to be in the <a href="../glossary/past_tense.htm">past tense</a>.

<ul>
<li> He <b>talked</b> with more claret than clarity. (Susan Ertz)</li>
("Talked" is the past tense of the verb "to talk.")<br><br>
<li> I <b>ran</b> to the lake.</li>
("Ran" is the past tense of the verb "to run.")<br><br>
<li> They <b>were</b> all there.</li>
("Were" is the past tense of the verb "to be.")
</ul>

<h2>Present Tense</h2>

Verbs that express actions occurring now are said to be in the <a href="../glossary/present_tense.htm">present tense</a>.

<ul>
<li> John <b>jumps</b> out the window.</li>
("Jumps" is the present tense of the verb "to jump.")<br><br>
<li> Who <b>is</b> ill?</li>
("Is" is the present tense of the verb "to be.")<br><br>

<li> He <b>is</b> the kind of a guy who <b>lights up</b> a room just by flicking a switch.</li>
("Is" is the present tense of the verb "to be," and 
"lights up" is the present tense of the verb "to light up.")
</ul>

<h2>Future Tense</h2>

Verbs that express actions in the future are said to be in the <a href="../glossary/future_tense.htm">future tense</a>. These are usually formed by preceding the verb with the word "will."

<ul>
<li> I <b>will take</b> the blame.</li>
("Will take" is the future tense of the verb "to take.")<br><br>
<li> They <b>will surrender</b>. </li>
("Will surrender" is the future tense of the verb "to surrender.")<br><br>
<li> Give me where to stand, and I <b>will move</b> the earth. (Archimedes, 287-212 BC)</li>
("Will move" is the future tense of the verb "to move.")
</ul>

<a href="../tests/verb_tenses_test.htm">Take a test on verb tenses</a>.

<h2>Subject of a Verb</h2>

The person or thing performing the action of the verb is said to be the <a href="../glossary/subject.htm">subject of the
verb</a> or the "subject of the sentence."

<ul>
<li> <b>Tony</b> stole the boat.</li>
("Tony" is the subject of the verb "to steal.")<br><br>
<li> <b>The dog</b> is guilty.</li>
("The dog" is the subject of the verb "to be.")<br><br>
<li> <b>Who</b> was that?</li>
("Who" is the subject of the verb "to be.")
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/subject.htm">Read more about the subject of a verb</a>.


<h2>Direct Object of a Verb</h2>

Many verbs perform an action on something. This is called the <a href="../glossary/direct_object.htm">direct object</a> of the verb.

<ul>
<li> Terry kissed <b>her hand</b>.</li>
("Her hand" is the direct object of the verb "to kiss.")<br><br>
<li> Beverly can eat <b>a whole chicken</b>.</li>
("A whole chicken" is the direct object of the verb "to eat.")
</ul>

Some verbs cannot have a direct object. These verbs are called <a href="../glossary/intransitive_verbs.htm">intransitive verbs</a>.

<ul>
<li> The rain <b>fell</b> heavily.</li>
(The rain fell, but it did not perform an action on anything. In this example, the verb "to fall" is an intransitive verb.)<br><br>
<li> Jack <b>protested</b> in the street.</li>
(Jack protested, but he did not perform an action on anything. In this example, the verb "to protest" is an intransitive verb.)
</ul>

Verbs that can have a direct object (most of them) are called <a href="../glossary/transitive_verbs.htm">transitive verbs</a>.

<ul>
<li> Barney <b>copied</b> the answer.</li>
(The verb "copied" is a transitive verb. The direct object of the verb is "the answer.")<br><br>
<li> Terry <b>saw</b> a black fin cutting through the water.</li>
(The verb "saw" is a transitive verb. The direct object of the verb is "a black fin.")
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/direct_object.htm">Read more about direct objects</a>.

<h2>Indirect Object of a Verb</h2>

Some verbs have two objects, a direct object and an <a href="../glossary/indirect_object.htm">indirect
object</a>. The indirect object is the person or thing for whom the action was performed.


<ul>
<li> Jamie read <b>the children</b> a story.</li>
(Here, "a story" is the direct object, and "the children" is the indirect object.)<br><br>
<li> I will bake <b>him</b> a cake.</li>
(Here, "a cake" is the direct object, and "him" is the indirect object.)<br><br>
<li> The postman gives <b>Anne</b> a letter every day.</li>
(Here, "a letter" is the direct object, and "Anne" is the indirect object.)
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/indirect_object.htm">Read more about indirect objects</a>.


<h2>Passive Sentence</h2>

The subject of a sentence does not always do the action of the verb. Sometimes, the action is done to the subject. Such sentences are called <a href="../glossary/passive_sentences.htm">passive sentences</a> because the subjects are being passive, i.e., not doing anything. 

<ul>
<li> Carl was arrested.</li>
("Carl" is not doing anything, but he is the subject of the sentence.)<br>
(Note: "Carl" is the subject of the verb "to be.")
</ul>

Passive verbs always comprise two parts ("was arrested" in this example). The person doing the action of the verb in a passive sentence is usually shown with the word "by."

<ul>
<li> Carl was arrested by PC Adams.</li>
</ul>

Passive verbs are said to be in the <a href="../glossary/passive_voice.htm">passive voice</a>. Passive sentences can be quite useful:

<ul>
<li> The carpet was damaged.</li>
(This is a passive sentence. No one is blamed for damaging the carpet.)
<li> Mark damaged the carpet.</li>
(A passive sentence contrasts with an active sentence (where the subject performs the verb). This is an example of an active sentence. It tells us that Mark damaged the carpet.)
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/passive_sentences.htm">Read more about passive sentences</a>.

<h2>Active Sentence</h2>

<a href="../glossary/active_sentences.htm">Active sentences</a> contrast with passive sentences. In an active sentence, the subject of the verb performs the action.

<ul>
<li> We damaged the carpet.</li>
(This is an active sentence. "We" is the subject. "We damaged" the carpet.)<br><br>
<li> Jamie read a story.</li>
(This is an active sentence. "Jamie" is the subject. "Jamie read" a story.)
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/active_sentences.htm">Read more about active sentences</a>.

<h2>Conjugation of Verbs</h2>

A verb will change its form a little depending on the subject. For example:

<ul>
<li> I write.</li>
<li> He writes.</li><br>

<li> The jackal laughs.</li>
<li> The jackals laugh.</li>
</ul>

When verbs change in this way, it is known as "conjugation." A verb conjugates according to the subject. The subject of a verb can be in one of six forms:

<ul>
<li>I</li>
<li>You</li>
<li>He / She / It</li>
<li>We</li>
<li>You</li>
<li>They</li>
</ul>

The first three are the singular forms (known as <a href="../glossary/first_person.htm">first person</a> singular, <a href="../glossary/second_person.htm">second person</a> singular, and <a href="../glossary/third_person.htm">third person</a> singular). The second three are the plural forms (known as first person plural, second person plural and third person plural).<br><br>

All subjects fit into one of these categories. For example, "jackal" is like "he" (i.e., third person singular) and "jackals" is like "they" (i.e., third person plural). (This subject rarely causes problems for native English speakers, who conjugate verbs correctly without much thought.)<br><br>

Interestingly, this is the origin of the insurance term "third party" (i.e., it's insurance covering actions by "them").<br><br>

<h2>Participles</h2>

Participles are formed from verbs. There are two types: <a href="../glossary/present_participle.htm">present participles</a> and <a href="../glossary/past_participles.htm">past participles</a>. Present participles end <b>-ing</b>. Past participles have various endings (e.g., <b>-ed</b>, <b>-en</b>). Below is a table showing some participles:<br>

<table class="gridtable"><tr>
<th>Verb</th>
<th>Present Participle</th>
<th>Past Participle</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to sing</td>
<td>singing</td>
<td>sung</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to drive</td>
<td>driving</td>
<td>driven</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to go</td>
<td>going</td>
<td>gone</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to rise</td>
<td>rising</td>
<td>risen</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to watch</td>
<td>watching</td>
<td>watched</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>to be</td>
<td>being</td>
<td>been</td>
</tr>

</table><br>

Participles are classified as adjectives. (Note: When a verb form (like a participle) functions as an adjective or a noun, it is known as a <a href="../glossary/verbals.htm">verbal</a>.) Below are some examples of participles being used as adjectives:

<ul>
<li> Our business is badly affected by the <b>soaring</b> price of wool.</li>
(The word "soaring" is a present participle. Here, it is being used as an adjective to describe "price.")<br><br>

<li> He is a <b>forgotten</b> hero.</li>
(The word "forgotten" is a past participle. Here, it is being used as an adjective to describe "hero.")
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Verbs? </h2>

Even though there's a lot of terminology associated with verbs, native English speakers are really good at using them (e.g., using the right tense, conjugating verbs correctly). We can handle all this stuff without giving the grammar a second thought. Nevertheless, the terms covered on this page will definitely be useful if you decide to learn a foreign language or to teach English because, if you do, you will encounter all of these terms. Knowing what they mean in English is a great starting point for learning how these features are addressed in other languages. <br><br>

That said, some of the terms covered in this entry do have their own oddities or traps, and these are covered on their individual pages. At the "verb" level, there are five good reasons to think more carefully about verbs. 

<h2>(Reason 1) Write flowing sentences.</h2>

We fill our speech with verbs. For that reason, speech is great. It's clear and structured naturally. Writing, on the other hand, can be boring, corporate, predictable, and structured abnormally. These bad traits are most often caused by an overuse of nouns. <br><br>

So, a good trick to ensure your writing leans towards verbs and not nouns is to <b>say your sentence aloud</b> and make that the start point of your sentence structure. This is a good way to get some verbs into your writing and to limit yourself to just enough nouns to get the job done. 

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>Unnatural (Overusing Nouns)</th><th>Natural (Deploying a Good Verb)</th></tr>
<tr><td>I was under the mistaken assumption you had made the payment.</td><td>I mistakenly assumed you had paid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>They are in agreement that he was in violation of several regulations.</td><td>They agree he violated several regulations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>She will be in attendance to present a demonstration of how the weather will have an effect on our process.</td><td>She will attend to demonstrate how the weather will affect our process.</td></tr>
</table>

Opting for verbs over nouns will not only make your sentences flow better but also reduce your word count because you will avoid the articles (e.g., "an," "the") and prepositions (e.g., "in," "on") required to make nouns work. <br><br>

There's another refinement. To optimize your sentence flow and to reduce your word count even further, opt for action verbs over <a href="../glossary/linking_verbs.htm">linking verbs</a>, which – like nouns – can sound a little stuffy. 

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>Stuffy (Using Linking Verbs)</th><th>Natural (Using Action Verbs)</th></tr>
<tr><td>This rule <b>is</b> applicable to both teams.</td><td>This rule <b>applies</b> to both teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>The treaty <b>is</b> binding for all parties.</td><td>The treaty <b>binds</b> all parties.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>(Reason 2) Ensure your subject and verb agree in number.</h2>
Here is an excellent reason to care about verbs: <a href="../lessons/subject_verb_agreement.htm">subject-verb agreement</a>.<br><br>

"Subject-verb agreement" means using the right version of the verb to agree with the subject. It just means saying "The cat <b>was</b> hungry" and not "The cat <b>were</b> hungry." In other words, it's about changing a verb to match its subject (called "verb conjugation").<br><br>

Verb conjugation is a simple concept, but there are many traps that cause writers to match a <a href="../glossary/singular.htm">singular</a> subject with a <a href="../glossary/plural_definition.htm">plural</a> verb or vice versa. When this mistake occurs, we say there is <b>no subject-verb agreement</b>. A subject and its verb must agree.<br><br>

Here are three examples of sentences with no subject-verb agreement. (The verbs are shown in bold.)

<ul>
<li> Either of the buttons <b>work</b>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
("Works" would be correct because "either" is singular.) 
<li> The agenda <b>are</b> pinned on the wall. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
("Agenda" is now accepted as a singular word, despite deriving from the plural of "agendum.")
<li> Jack as well as Jill <b>fall</b> down the hill. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
("Falls" would be correct because "as well as" does not create a <a href="../glossary/compound_subject.htm">compound subject</a> like "and" does.) 
</ul>

<a href="../lessons/subject_verb_agreement.htm">Read more about the traps that cause no subject-verb agreement</a>.


<h2>(Reason 3) Avoid common spelling errors related to verbs.</h2>

Here are some common spelling errors caused by failing to spot a verb:

<ul>
<li><a href="../easily_confused/accept_except.htm">"Accept" is a verb, but "except" usually isn't</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../easily_confused/advice_advise.htm">"Advise" is verb, but "advice" isn't</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../easily_confused/affect_effect.htm">"Affect" is usually a verb, but "effect" usually isn't</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../easily_confused/loose_lose.htm">"Lose" is usually a verb, but "loose" usually isn't</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../easily_confused/marinade_marinate.htm">"Marinate" is a verb, but "marinade" isn't</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../easily_confused/past_passed.htm">"Passed" is a verb, but "past" isn't</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../easily_confused/practice_practise.htm">In British English, "practise" is a verb, but "practice" isn't</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../easily_confused/licence_license.htm">In British English, "license" is a verb, but "licence" isn't</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>(Reason 4) Spot when you've written a sentence and end it appropriately.</h2>
 
Verbs are important. You can't write a <a href="../glossary/sentences.htm">sentence</a> without one. Remember that a sentence expresses a complete thought and includes a subject that governs at least one finite verb. It may sound basic, but lots of writers fail to spot when they've written a sentence. Consequently, they commit the most common mistake made by otherwise excellent writers: <a href="../glossary/run-on_sentence.htm">the run-on error</a>. The most common type of run-on error is writing a sentence, putting a comma, and then writing another sentence.

<ul>
<li>I don't know how to act my age, I've never been this old before. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
<li>Lazy is such an ugly word, I prefer to call it selective participation. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
<li>It was me, I let the dogs out. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
<li>My house was clean yesterday, I'm sorry you missed it. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
</ul>

Having written a sentence, writers are drawn to a comma because they've more to say and feel a period (full stop) is too abrupt a halt. It isn't. A period is fine. There are other options of course (e.g., a <a href="../punctuation/using_dashes.htm">dash</a>, a <a href="../punctuation/using_semicolons.htm">semicolon</a>, an <a href="../glossary/ellipsis.htm">ellipsis</a> (three dots), a <a href="../glossary/subordinating_conjunctions.htm">subordinating conjunction</a> like "because") – you just can't use a comma. <br><br>

What's this got to do with verbs? Well, spotting <a href="../glossary/finite_verbs.htm">finite verbs</a> and their <a href="../glossary/subject.htm">subjects</a> is a good start point for dividing your work into proper sentences. If you look at the wrong examples above, you will find a subject, a finite verb, and a complete thought either side of the comma, which means you're looking at two sentences.

<h2>(Reason 5) Spot when to use a comma after a conjunction (e.g., "and").</h2>

Of course, it is common for a sentence to consist of more than one <a href="../glossary/independent_clause.htm">independent clause</a>. (An independent clause is one that can stand alone as a sentence.) When these "standalone sentences" are joined with a conjunction (e.g., "and," "but," "or"), it is normal to put a comma before the conjunction.

<ul>
<li>Actors are con men, <b>and</b> con men are actors. (Actor Edward Burns)</li>
(This sentence comprises two "standalone sentences" (i.e., independent clauses). The comma before "and" is correct.)
</ul>

When a conjunction does not join two independent clauses, it is normal not to use a comma.

<ul>
<li>My grandmother was gruff <b>and</b> looked very fierce. She was quite small, <b>but</b> she was very wide. (Author Salman Rushdie)</li>
(Here, the words "looked very fierce" is not an independent clause because there's no subject. However, the words "she was very wide" is an independent clause. That's why there's no comma before "and" but one before "but.")
</ul>

What's this got to do with verbs? Well, spotting finite verbs and their subjects is a good start point for dividing your work into independent clauses, and that's key for determining whether to use commas before conjunctions.<br><br>

<h2>Using Apostrophes</h2>

Apostrophes have four uses:<br><br>

<b>(1) To show possession.</b>

	<ul>
	<li> a dog's kennel <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	<li> our boys' bedroom <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>

<b>(2) To write time expressions.</b>

	<ul>
	<li> a day's pay <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	<li> two weeks' holiday <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>

<b>(3) To replace letters in contractions.</b>

	<ul>
	<li> can't <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>

<h2 class="text-centred">More about Using Apostrophes</h2>

This page covers the rules for using apostrophes. It also has <a href="#resources">six useful resources</a> for learning about apostrophes, including two videos, an interactive widget, an infographic, a slide show, and links to some exercises.
 
<h2>(1) Using Apostrophes for Possession</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/apostrophe_possession.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="Apostrophes for Possession" /><br><br>
</center>

Apostrophes are used to show possession. For example: 

<ul>
<li>The dog's kennel <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>The dogs' kennel <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

<b>Does the apostrophe go before or after the "s"?</b><br><br>

The big question is whether to put the apostrophe before the "s" or after the "s." The basic rules are as follows:<br>

<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>The Basic Rules</b></center><br><br>
The apostrophe goes <b>before</b> the "s" for a <b>singular</b> possessor:

<ul>
<li> one dog's kennel <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

It goes <b>after</b> the "s" for a plural possessor: 

<ul>
<li> two dogs' kennel <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>


There are exceptions to these rules, and they are covered below. However, here is a simple 100% rule that works for everything:<br><br>

<b>The 100% Rule:</b> Everything to the left of the apostrophe is the possessor.<br><br>

Write the word as you'd say it (e.g., "dogs kennel"), and then apply this rule. You get <i>dog's</i> for one dog, and <i>dogs'</i> for more than one. This rule works for everything, even the exceptions.
</ul>

</div>
</center>

Keep in mind that, in the two examples above, "dog" and "dogs" are the possessors. The position of the apostrophe has nothing to do with "kennel." That word can be singular or plural. It makes no difference whatsoever to where the apostrophe goes. For example: 

<ul>
<li>One dog's dinner <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>One dog's dinners <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>Two dogs' dinner <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>Two dogs' dinners <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

The apostrophe-placement ruling seems quite straightforward, but there are exceptions.<br><br>  

<b>An exception to the rule: plural words that don't end "s"</b><br><br>

The most notable exception is when the plural doesn't end in "s" (e.g., "children," "women," "people," "men"). These words have the apostrophe before the "s" (even though they're plural). For example:

<ul>
<li>children's toys <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>women's hat <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(Here's another issue. It's not always about possession. This means a hat <b>for</b> women. Similarly, "Picasso's painting" is a painting <b>by</b> Picasso. He doesn't own it.  Sometimes, it's about "possession" in the loosest terms.) 
<li>people's poet <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>men's sizes <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

<b>Another exception to the rule: singular words that end "s"</b><br><br>

Another quirk is that singular nouns ending "s" (e.g., "Wales," "Moses," "John Wells") form their possessive forms either by adding <b>'</b> (just an apostrophe) or <b>'s</b> depending on how you (personally) say the possessive form. For example:

<ul>
<li>John Wells' report <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(This is correct. It is used by those who would say "John Wells report" as opposed to "John Wellsiz report.")
<li>John Wells's report <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(This is also correct. It is used by those who would say "John Wellsiz report.")
</ul>

Be aware that some style guides state you can't use the <b>'s</b> version for religious characters. So, if you're talking about the likes of "Jesus" or "Moses," you might want to opt for the <b>Jesus'</b> and <b>Moses'</b> versions as opposed to <b>Jesus's</b> and <b>Moses's</b>.<br><br>

<h2>Are You Good at Possessive Apostrophes?</h2>

<h2>(2) Using Apostrophes in Time Expressions</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/apostrophe_temporal.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="Apostrophes in Time Expressions" /><br><br>
</center>

Apostrophes can be used in time expressions (also called "temporal expressions") like "a day's pay" and "two weeks' notice." <br><br>
The big question with these is where to put the apostrophe. The ruling is quite simple: the apostrophe goes before the "s" for a single unit of time (e.g., one day's pay) and after the "s" when it's more than one (e.g., two days' pay). <br><br>
Examples:

<ul>
<li>I never did a day's work in my life. It was all fun. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (Inventor Thomas Edison)</li>
<li>It's not worth it for just two minutes' pleasure.</li>
</ul>

It's not always about time. For example: 

<ul>
<li>I live a stone's throw away. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

Don't think you have to use an apostrophe every time you write "seconds," "minutes," "hours," "days," "weeks," "months," etc. Only use an apostrophe where the word "of" could have been used.

<ul>
<li>a year's insurance <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(a year "of" insurance)
<li>two weeks' holiday <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(two weeks "of" holiday)
</ul>

<h2>(3) Using Apostrophes to Replace Letters in Contractions</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/apostrophe_contraction.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="Apostrophes in Contractions" /><br><br>
</center>

An apostrophe can be used to replace a letter or letters (e.g., "isn't," "can't"). The new word formed is called a <a href="../glossary/contractions.htm">contraction</a>. Contractions are not usually used in formal correspondence.

<ul>
<li>When I was born I was so surprised I didn't talk for a year and a half. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (Comedian Gracie Allen)</li>
<li>Life is something that happens when you can't get to sleep. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (Author Fran Lebowitz)
</ul>

Contractions are most commonly used in informal writing to reflect how we speak. These two contractions are notorious grammar villains: <a href="../easily_confused/its_its.htm">it's</a> and <a href="../easily_confused/youre_your.htm">you're</a>.<br><br>

<h2>(4) Using Apostrophes in Awkward Plurals</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/apostrophe_plurals_unusual.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="Apostrophes for Plurals" /><br><br>
</center>

The first thing to say about this topic is that apostrophes are not normally used to show plurals, and lots of your readers will hate it if you use an apostrophe for this purpose. However, that said, there are times when it helps to use an apostrophe to show a plural. For example: 

<ul>
<li>There are two i's in skiing. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
<li>You use too many but's in your writing. <img src="../images/tick.png" />
</ul>

Of course, there are other ways of writing these. 

For example: 

<ul>
<li>There are two Is in skiing. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
<li>You use too many "but"s in your writing. <img src="../images/tick.png" />
</ul>

The bottom line is apostrophes can be used in this way and for good reason &mdash; the apostrophe version is usually neater and clearer. However, be aware that you run the risk of annoying a high proportion of your readers if you do it.

<h2> Using Apostrophes Incorrectly with Plurals</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/apostrophe_plurals.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="Apostrophe Mistakes with Plurals" /><br><br>
</center>

Don't add an apostrophe to a word just because the word ends with the letter "s." This is a common mistake, and it is a grammatical howler. (In other words, your readers will think you're a bit dim if you keep doing it.)<br><br>

This mistake is most commonly seen when people <a href="../lessons/plural_forms_of_words.htm">form the plurals of nouns</a>, but it happens with <a href="../lessons/verbs.htm">verbs</a> too; e.g., He eat's pies. <img src="../images/cross.png" /><br><br> 

Examples:

<ul>
<li>I like pig's. Dog's look up to us. Cat's look down on us. Pig's treat us as equal's. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(These are all wrong.)
<li>I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as<br>equals. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>

<li>A spoken word is not a sparrow. Once it fly's out, you cannot catch it. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(This mistake is sometimes made with <a href="../lessons/verbs.htm">verbs</a> too. This should be "flies.")

<li>Tomato's and oregano make it Italian; wine and tarragon make it French; garlic makes it good. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(This mistake is particularly common when forming the plural of a noun which ends in a <a href="../glossary/vowels.htm">vowel</a> (e.g., video's <img src="../images/cross.png" />, banana's <img src="../images/cross.png" />). It should be "tomatoes" in this example.)
</ul>

<h2>Using Semicolons</h1>

Semicolons have four uses:<br><br>

<b>(1) To separate list items (when the list items contain commas).</b>

	<ul>
	<li> Brian, the officer in charge; Mark, the chef; and Dexter, my dog <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	</ul>

<b>(2) To create a smoother transition between two sentences.</b>

<ul>
<li> Write with the door closed; rewrite with the door open. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (Author Stephen King)</li>
</ul>

<b>(3) To create a smooth transition into a sentence starting with a transitional phrase (e.g., "however," "as a result")</b>


	<ul>
	<li> It was freezing; however, we still enjoyed it. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	</ul>

<b>(4) To merge two comma-filled sentences joined with a conjunction (e.g., "and," "or," "but")</b>

	<ul>
	<li> Yesterday, it was, to our surprise, sunny; but today, as expected, it's dull. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top: 30px;">More about Using Semicolons</h2>

Semicolons are used to make lists clearer, but, mostly, they are used to control the flow of text from one sentence to the next.<br><br>

Below are more details and more examples covering the four uses of the semicolon. 

<h2>(1) Using Semicolons to Separate List Items</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/semicolons_lists.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using semicolons in lists" /><br><br>
</center>

Semicolons can be used in lists to outrank any commas that appear in list items. That's less complicated than it sounds.<br><br>

This is a normal list:

<ul>
<li>the master, the servant, and the cook</li>
</ul>

In a normal list, the list items are separated by <a href="../lessons/commas.htm">commas</a>. However, sometimes the list items themselves contain commas. When this happens, you can use semicolons to separate them. For example:

<ul>
<li>the master, aged 81; the servant, aged 19; and the cook, aged 31 <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

Not all of your list items have to contain commas to justify using semicolons. In fact, only one does. For example:

<ul>
<li>the master, aged 81; the servant; and the cook <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

You can also use <a href="using_brackets_parentheses.htm">parentheses (i.e., brackets)</a> if you need to add more information. For example:

<ul>
<li>the master, aged 81 (82 next week); the servant; and the cook</li>
</ul>

Lists can get quite complicated. If the information is important, you should consider using <a href="../lessons/using_bullet_points.htm">bullet points</a>.<br><br>



<a href='../lessons/semicolons_in_lists.htm'>Read more about semicolons in lists</a>.

<h2>(2) Using a Semicolon to Create a Smooth Transition between Two Sentences</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/semicolons_extend.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using a semicolon to merge two sentences" /><br><br>
</center>

A semicolon can be used to replace a period (full stop) when a smooth transition is required between sentences. For example:

<ul>
<li>It was serious. She broke a toe. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
<li>It was serious; she broke a toe. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(A semicolon is less of a "speed bump" than starting a new sentence.)
</ul>

Here is another example:

<ul>
<li>Never pick a fight with an ugly person. They've got nothing to lose. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
<li>Never pick a fight with an ugly person; they've got nothing to lose. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
</ul>

You cannot create a smooth transition between two sentences with a <a href="using_commas.htm">comma</a>. For example: 

<ul>
<li>It was serious, she broke a toe. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
<li>Never pick a fight with an ugly person, they've got nothing to lose. <img src="../images/cross.png" /> </li>
</ul>

These are <a href="../lessons/commas_run-on_error.htm">run-on errors</a>. (The run-on error is a common mistake.)

<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>Do Not Overuse Semicolons!</b></center><br><br>

Do not use too many semicolons in your writing. They get annoying quickly. Here are three scenarios when it would be acceptable to use a semicolon instead of a period (full stop):<br><br>

<b>(Scenario 1) When your two sentences feel like cause and effect.</b><br><br>

If you could merge your two sentences into one with a word like "because" or "as" (called <a href="../glossary/subordinating_conjunctions.htm">subordinating conjunctions</a>), then consider a semicolon.

	<ul>
	<li> I am glad that I paid so little attention to good advice; <strike>because</strike> had I abided by it I might have been saved from some of my most valuable mistakes. (Playwright Edna St. Vincent Millay) <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	</ul>

<b>(Scenario 2) When your two sentences have similar structures and deliberate repetition.</b>

	<ul>
	<li> You don't pay taxes; they take taxes. (Comedian Chris Rock)</li>
	<li> Write with the door closed; rewrite with the door open. (Author Stephen King)</li></li>
	</ul>

<b>(Scenario 3) When your two sentences could be merged with a comma and a conjunction, e.g., "and," "or," "but," "for," "so" (especially "but," "for," and "so").</b>

	<ul>
	<li> Go not to the elves for counsel; they will say both no and yes. </li>
	(This is acceptable.)
	<li> Go not to the elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes. </li>
	(This is original text by JRR Tolkien. Note the comma and "for.")</li>
	</ul>
	
</div>
</center>


<h2>(3) To Create a Smooth Transition into a Sentence Starting with a Transitional Phrases</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/semicolons_transitional.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using a semicolon before however" /><br><br>
</center>

This point is closely related to the last one. Often, when merging two sentences into one, the second sentence will start with a transitional phrase (or a <a href="../glossary/conjunctive_adverbs.htm">conjunctive adverb</a> as it's called). Common ones are "as a result," "consequently," "therefore," and "however."<br><br>

A conjunctive adverb usually starts with a capital letter and follows a period (full stop), but it is possible to create a smoother transition by replacing the period with a semicolon. For example:

<ul>
<li>She broke her toe. <span class="highlight">As a result</span>, the game was cancelled. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
<li>She broke her toe; <span class="highlight">as a result</span>, the game was cancelled. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
</ul>

Here is another example:

<ul>
<li>Vacation used to be a luxury. <span class="highlight">However</span>, in today's world, it's become a necessity. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
<li>Vacation used to be a luxury; <span class="highlight">however</span>, in today's world, it's become a necessity. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
</ul>

Note: You cannot do this with a comma. 

<ul>
<li>She broke her toe, <span class="highlight">as a result</span>, the game was cancelled. <img src="../images/cross.png" /> </li>
<li>Vacation used to be a luxury, <span class="highlight">however</span>, in today's world, it's become a necessity. <img src="../images/cross.png" /> </li>
</ul>


These are both <a href="../lessons/commas_run-on_error.htm">run-on errors</a>. (Note that the <a href="../lessons/commas_after_a_transitional_phrase.htm">commas <b>after</b> the transitional phrase</a> are all correct.)<br><br>

<h2>(4) Using a Semicolon to Merge Two Comma-filled Sentences Joined with a Conjunction</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/semicolons_conjunction.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using a semicolon before and or but" /><br><br>
</center>

It is common to merge two sentences into one using a <a href="../lessons/conjunctions.htm">conjunction</a> (a word like "and," "or," "but"). For example:

<ul>
<li>Lee likes cake. He likes pies.</li>
<li>Lee likes cake, and he likes pies.</li>
(Here, the conjunction "and" has been used to merge the two "sentences" into one. NB: The sentences are now <a href="../glossary/independent_clauses.htm">independent clauses</a>.)
</ul>

When this happens, it is normal to use a comma before the <a href="../lessons/conjunctions_and_commas.htm">conjunction</a>.<br><br>

However, when the "sentences" themselves contain commas, it is possible to outrank those commas by using a semicolon before the conjunction instead of a comma. For example:

<ul>
<li>At the end of the day, Lee likes cake; and he likes, well, actually prefers, pies.</i>
(This is quite an outdated practice, but you can use a semicolon for this purpose if you think it'll help your readers.)
</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>If space allows, write your complicated list with bullet points. They're much clearer.</li>
<li>If you have two sentences that you can't bear to be separated by a period (full stop), you can unite them using a semicolon. Don't do it too often though; semicolons get annoying quickly.</li>

<h5>The Quick Answer</h5>

The colon has four uses:<br><br>

<b>(1) To extend a sentence in order to identify something previously mentioned in the sentence.</b>

<ul>
<li> I demand one personal trait: discipline. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(The colon extends the sentence and identifies "personal trait.")
</ul>

<b>(2) After an introduction.</b>

<ul>
<li>I have seen the following: ants, a cockroach, and a rat. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

<b>(3) In references, times, and titles.</b>

<ul>
<li> Read Genesis 1:1 before 07:30.  <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

<b>(4) To introduce a quotation.</b>

<h2 class="text-centred">More about Using Colons</h2>

Colons (:) are quite versatile. It is worth learning how to use them &mdash; especially how colons allow you to expand on an idea previously mentioned in the sentence. (If you can master this idea, you'll have a useful tool in your writing toolkit.)

<h2>(1) Using Colons to Extend a Sentence</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/colons_extend.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using colons to expand a sentence" /><br><br>
</center>


Think of a colon (:) as the language version of an equals sign (=) in mathematics. The information on the left of the colon equals the information on the right.<br><br>
Usually, the information on the right is an expansion of whatever is mentioned on the left. For example:

<ul>
<li> He blamed his divorce on one thing: beer. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li> (one thing = beer)
<li> There are two reasons why I don't believe the alibi: there is no visa in his passport, and he is petrified of flying. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li> (two reasons = the visa idea and the flying idea)
</ul>
Sometimes, the ideas either side of the "equals sign" are a little harder to marry up. For example:

<ul>
<li> I have made an important discovery: alcohol, taken in sufficient quantities, produces all the effects of intoxication. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (Playwright Oscar Wilde)</li>
(discovery = the alcohol idea)
</ul>


<center>
<div class="messageBox">
<center><b>A Colon Is Like an Equals Sign</b></center><br>
When using a colon to extend a sentence to expand on something previously mentioned in the sentence, think of a colon as an equals sign. For example:

<ul>
<li> I need one personal trait: discipline. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(personal trait = discipline)
<li>I would like to change just one aspect of your draft: the words. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(one aspect = the words)
</ul>
</div>
</center>

<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>Beware</b></center><br><br>
You cannot introduce a new idea with a colon. For example:
<ul>
<li> I need one personal trait: I have others but not the one I need. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(personal trait = discipline)
<li>I would like to change just one aspect of your draft: then you can publish it. <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li>
(one aspect = the words)
</ul>
</div>
</center>




<h2>(2) Using Colons after Introductions</h2>


<center>
<img src="pics/colons_intro.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using colons for introductions" /><br><br>
</center>


A colon can be used after an introduction. The wording to the left of the colon will introduce whatever follows on the right. For example:

<ul>
<li> The Victorian printing set is missing the following characters: Q, R, K, and the question mark. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>
<table class="gridtable"><tr><td><b>He voted for the following films: <b> <img src="../images/tick.png" /><br><br>

(1) Jaws<br>
(2) The Princess Bride<br>
(3) Shawshank Redemption<br></b>

</td></tr></table></li>

</ul>
Note: You cannot use a <a href="using_semicolons.htm">semicolon</a> (;) for this purpose.<br><br>

<h2>(3) Using Colons in References and Times</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/colons_references.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using colons in references" /><br><br>
</center>

Colons can be used to divide the parts of references, titles, and times. For example:

<ul>
<li> I am currently reading "How To Get Your Own Way: Who's Manipulating You?". <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(Here, the colon is used to separate the main title from the subtitle.)
<li> Genesis 1:1 starts "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(Colon used as a separator in a Bible reference)
<li>07:30 - Breakfast<br>
08:30 - Meet at the lake and prepare the kayaks<br>
09:00 - Select teams</li>
(Colons used as a separator in times.)</ul>

<h2>(4) Using Colons with Quotation Marks</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/colons_quotes.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using colons with quotations" /><br><br>
</center>

Colons can be used to introduce quotations. For example:

<ul>
<li> It's hard to disagree with Frank Zappa, who said: "Art is making something out of nothing and selling it." </li>
</ul>

In this example, the quotation is introduced with a colon. However, it could have been introduced with a comma or with nothing. There is a useful guideline out there which states that if your quotation is longer than six words (and you're not worried about controlling the flow of text), then use a colon. (Note: This is just a guideline to remove the need to think about what punctuation to use. It's definitely not a strict rule.)<br><br>

<h2>Using Commas</h2>

Commas have ten uses:<br><br>


<b>(1) After setting the scene at the start of a sentence</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> <span class="highlight">Now that I am older</span>, I understand. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>

<b>(2) After a phrase like "however," "consequently," or "as a result."</b><br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> <span class="highlight">As a result</span>, I now understand. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>


<b>(3) After an interjection (e.g., an expression of joy or surprise)</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> <span class="highlight">Wow</span>, I see your point. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>


<b>(4) Before a conjunction (e.g., "and," "but") that joins two "sentences."</b><br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> <span class="highlight">I like cake</span>, and <span class="highlight">I like cheese</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>

<b>(5) As parentheses around additional information (i.e., like brackets)</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> Janet and John Baxter, <span class="highlight">who live next door</span>, adore cakes. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>

<b>(6) To separate list items</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> bread, milk, and cheese <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (<img src="../images/flag_us.gif" />)</li>
	<li> bread, milk and cheese <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (<img src="../images/flag_uk.gif" />)</li>
	</ul>

<b>(7) After a long subject if it helps the reader</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> <span class="highlight">A, B, C, and D</span>, are required to bake this cake. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>

<b>(8) In numbers</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> 3,213 <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>


<b>(9) With direct address (also called "the vocative case")</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> I know your auntie, <span class="highlight">John</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li> 
	</ul>

<b>(10) Before a quotation</b>.<br><br>

For example:

	<ul>
	<li> She said, "I understand." <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
	</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top: 50px;">More about the Rules for Using Commas</h2>
This section explains when to use commas in more detail and gives examples for each type of comma usage.


<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>Comma? Take a Breath</b></center><br><br>
At school, many of us were told that a comma is where you take a breath. This is fairly good advice when you're <b>reading</b> someone else's work aloud. However, it is terrible advice when you're thinking about where to put commas in your own work.<br><br>

The ten rules for using commas are listed above and detailed below. The idea that you should put a comma whenever you want your reader to take a breath is wrong.<br><br>

<img src="../images/108.png" style="margin: -20px 10px 0px 15px;" align="left"/> That's a <b>reading</b> technique not a <b>writing</b> technique.

<h2>(1) Using Commas after "Setting the Scene"</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/commas_intro.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas after a sentence introduction"/><br><br>
</center>

It is quite common for a sentence to start with words which "set the scene." These words usually state a place, a time, a condition, or a fact before the main part of the sentence. Words that "set the scene" at the start of a sentence are usually followed by a comma.  You do not have to use a comma; i.e., it is not a strict ruling. It's just a common style. However, as it will help your reader, it is a useful style to adopt. For example:

<ul>
<li> <span class="highlight">In Paris</span>, they simply stared when I spoke to them in French. <img src="../images/tick.png " /></li>
(sets a place)
<li> <span class="highlight">At exactly 4 o'clock</span>, two of the kidnappers re-entered the room. <img src="../images/tick.png " /></li>
(sets a time)

<li> <span class="highlight">If you don't know where you are going</span>, you will probably end up somewhere else. <img src="../images/tick.png " /> (Laurence J. Peter, 1919-1988)</li>
(sets a condition)

<li> <span class="highlight">As you were born here</span>, it makes sense for my group to take the map. <img src="../images/tick.png " /> </li>
(states a fact)

</ul>

Often, the words that "set the scene" are a little harder to spot:

<ul>
<li> <span class="highlight"> When a man tells you that he got rich through hard work </span>, ask him "Whose?" <img src="../images/tick.png " /> 
(Don Marquis, 1878-1937)</li>
(sets a time)
</ul>

These "scene setting" words (or <a href="../glossary/adverbial_clauses.htm">adverbial clauses</a> or <a href="../glossary/adverbial_phrases.htm">adverbial phrases</a> as they're really called) vary hugely. You do not have to use a comma after an adverbial clause or phrase, but a comma will make it clear where the main clause starts. 


When an adverbial clause or phrase is very short (e.g., <i>Nowadays</i>, <i>Now</i>, <i>Yesterday</i>, <i>Today</i>), you are safer to omit the comma. For example:

<ul>
<li><span class="highlight"> When I was a boy</span>, I was told that anybody could become President. <span class="highlight">Now</span>  I'm beginning to believe it. <img src="../images/tick.png " /> (Clarence Darrow, 1857 - 1938)</li>
(First "scene setting" adverb &ndash; comma used. Second "scene setting" adverb &ndash; no comma required)
</ul>

When an adverbial clause or phrase is at the end of a sentence, there is usually no need for a comma before it. When it is in the middle of a sentence, you should use commas (i.e., one at the start and one at the end) if you think the commas will help the reader.

For example:

<ul>
<li>Two of the kidnappers re-entered the room <span class="highlight"> at exactly 4 o'clock</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png " /> </li>
<li>Two of the kidnappers, <span class="highlight"> at exactly 4 o'clock</span>, re-entered the room. <img src="../images/tick.png " /> </li>
</ul>

<h2>(2) Using Commas after a Transitional Phrase (e.g, "However," "As a result")</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/commas_transitional.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using a comma after however"/><br><br>
</center>

A transitional phrase is a term like <i>However</i>, <i>Consequently</i>, <i>Therefore</i>, and <i>As a result</i>.  (There are others, but these are the most common.) A transitional phrase sits at the start of sentence and acts like a bridge to an idea in the previous sentence. A transitional phrase is usually followed by a comma. For example:

<ul>
<li>John has eaten at least two cakes a day for the last decade. <span class="highlight">As a result</span>, he has been placed in a high-risk group for diabetes. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>I think. <b>Therefore</b>, I am. <img src="../images/tick.png" /> Rene Descartes (1596-1650)</li>
<li>All progress is initiated by challenging current conceptions, and executed by supplanting existing institutions. <span class="highlight">Consequently</span>, the first condition of progress is the removal of censorships. George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li>Orthodox medicine has not found an answer to your complaint. <span class="highlight">However</span>, luckily for you, I happen to be a quack. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

A transitional phrase (or <a href="../glossary/conjunctive_adverbs.htm">conjunctive_adverb</a> as you will hear them called) is never preceded by a comma. You can, on occasion, precede it with a <a href="using_semicolons.htm">semicolon</a> (or a <a href="using_dashes.htm">dash replacing a semicolon</a>), but never a comma. That's called a <a href="../lessons/commas_run-on_error.htm">run-on error</a>.
<br><br>

<h2>(3) Using Commas after an Interjection</h2>


<center>
<img src="pics/commas_interjection.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas after interjections"/><br><br>
</center>

An <a href="../lessons/interjections.htm">interjection</a> is usually a short word inserted into a sentence to express an emotion or feeling.  Expressions such as <i>yes</i>, <i>phew</i>, and <i>indeed</i> are examples of interjections. Often, an interjection will sit at the start of the sentence but not always. It is normal to offset an interjection with a comma (or commas if it's in the middle of the sentence). In the examples below, the interjections are shaded: 

<ul>
<li> <span class="highlight">Oh great</span>, the boiler's broken down. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li> <span class="highlight">Yes, </span> that's three out of three. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li> I understand your predicament, but, <span class="highlight">crikey</span>, there is nothing we can do. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>

</ul>


Note: If the interjection is to express a powerful emotion or feeling (and it's not in the middle of your sentence), then it can be followed by an <a href="../glossary/exclamation_mark.htm">exclamation mark</a>.<br><br>

<h2>(4) Using Commas before a Conjunction</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/commas_conjunctions.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas before and and but" /><br>
</center>

Words like <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, and <i>but</i> are known as <a href="../lessons/conjunctions.htm">conjunctions</a>. (There are other conjunctions, but these three are the most common.)<br><br>
When a conjunction joins two standalone sentences (or <a href="../glossary/independent_clause.htm">independent clauses</a>), it is usual to place a comma before it. For example (conjunctions shaded):

<ul>
<li>Lee can sing, <span class="highlight">and</span> he can dance <img src="../images/tick.png " /></li>
(Here, the conjunction <a>and</a> is joining two standalone sentences: "Lee can sing." + "He can dance.")
<li>Lee can sing, <span class="highlight">and</span> dance <img src="../images/cross.png " /></li>
(Here, the conjunction <a>and</a> is not joining two standalone sentences. The words "and dance" are not a standalone sentence. This is just a list of things that Lee can do. This section is not about using commas in lists. That is covered below and in the lesson <a href='../lessons/commas_in_lists.htm'>Using Commas in Lists</a>.)
</ul>

Here are some real examples:

<ul>
<li> No amount of time can erase the memory of a good cat, <span class="highlight">and</span> no amount of masking tape can ever totally remove his fur from your couch. <img src="../images/tick.png " /> (Leo Buscaglia, 1925-1998)</li>
<li> When you have got an elephant by the hind leg, <span class="highlight">and</span> he is trying to run away, it's best to let him run. <img src="../images/cross.png " /> (Abraham Lincoln, 1809-1865)</li>
("When you have got an elephant by the hind leg" is not a standalone sentence.)

<h2>(5) Using Commas for Parentheses</h2>


<center>
<img src="pics/commas_parentheses.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas like brackets or parentheses"/><br><br>
</center>

We all know that additional information (such as an explanation or an afterthought) can be offset with brackets. However, <a href="../lessons/brackets_round_brackets.htm">brackets</a> are just one of the choices you have. You can also use commas or <a href="using_dashes.htm">dashes</a>. The information which is offset by commas, brackets, or dashes is called a <a href="../glossary/parenthesis.htm">parenthesis</a>. The punctuation marks used to offset a parenthesis (i.e., dashes, brackets, or commas) are called <a href="../glossary/parentheses_parenthetical_punctuation.htm">parentheses</a>.<br><br>Examples (with each example of parenthesis shaded):

<ul>
<li> The case has, <span class="highlight">in some respects</span>, been not entirely devoid of interest. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li> At 4 o'clock yesterday, David Frost, <span class="highlight"> a cleaner from the Lakes Estate</span>, was charged with "dog napping" his former headmaster's poodle. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li> Joanne Baxter, <span class="highlight"> who originally appeared as a witness</span>, has been found guilty of handling stolen goods. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(Note: When a parenthesis starts with <i>who</i> or <i>which</i> (i.e., a <a href="../glossary/relative_pronouns.htm">relative pronoun</a>), you should look to use commas as opposed to brackets or dashes. This is not a 100% rule, but commas are far more common when the parenthesis starts with a relative pronoun.) 
</ul>

Commas are often more suitable for formal writing than brackets, as brackets can make your work look a little unorganized. Also, commas are often preferable to dashes because dashes are quite stark. The disadvantage of using commas as parentheses is they can be easily confused with other commas in the sentence because &mdash; as you can see from this page &mdash; commas have lots of uses.<br><br>

<a href='../lessons/commas_for_parenthesis.htm'>Read more about using commas to replace brackets</a>.

<h2>(6) Using Commas in Lists</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/commas_lists.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas in lists"/><br><br>
</center>

When writing a list in "sentence form" (i.e., not as bullet points), it is normal to separate the list items using commas.  For example:

<ul>
<li>Fish, chips, and peas <img src="../images/tick.png " /></li>
</ul>

The big question is whether there needs to be a comma before the <a href="../lessons/conjunctions.htm">conjunction</a> (in this example, the word <i>and</i>). Unfortunately, there is no simple rule for this.<br><br>

The first part of the rule is easy enough: when there are just two items in a list, there is no need to use a comma between them. 

<ul>
<li>Fish and chips <img src="../images/tick.png " /></li>
</ul>

However, you can use a comma if you think it helps your reader. 

<ul>
<li>The Bakerloo Line runs between Harrow and Wealdston, and Elephant and Castle. <img src="../images/tick.png " /></li>
</ul>

When there are more than two list items in a list, then those following "US convention" should use a comma before the conjunction (usually <i>and</i> or <i>or</i>), and those following "UK convention" shouldn't.  Therefore:

<ul>
<li>Fish, chips, and peas <img src="../images/tick.png " /> (<img src="../images/flag_us.gif " />)</li>
<li>Fish, chips and peas <img src="../images/tick.png " /> (<img src="../images/flag_uk.gif " />)</li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, it gets a little more complicated than that. The comma before the conjunction is known as an <i>Oxford Comma</i>, and it is condoned by lots of individuals and organizations in the UK, and it is avoided by a few individuals and organizations in the US. Therefore: 

<ul>
<li>Fish, chips, and peas <img src="../images/tick.png " /> (<img src="../images/flag_uk.gif " />) (This is correct if you're an advocate for the Oxford Comma.)</li>
</ul>

The bottom line is you should follow whatever convention those around you (e.g., your company seniors) follow. If there is no guidance like that, then follow whatever convention you like &mdash; but be consistent. If you have to break that convention for the sake of clarity, then have the confidence to do it. Clarity trumps style every single time.
<br><br>

<h2>(7) Using Commas after a Long Subject</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/commas_subject.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas after long subjects"/><br><br>
</center>


When the <a href="../glossary/subject.htm">subject of a sentence</a> is made up of lots of elements, it is known as a <a href="../glossary/compound_subject.htm">compound subject</a>. For example: 

<ul>
<li> <b>Janet</b> is popular. </li>
(This is a normal subject (i.e., not a compound one). The subject has one element: Janet.)
<li> <b>Janet and John</b> are popular.</li>
(This is a compound subject because it has two elements: Janet and John.)
<li> <b>The large gorilla</b> is popular. </li>
(This is a normal subject. It has one element: The large gorilla.)
<li> <b>The large gorilla with the bright blue eyes and the albino lion cub with piercing pink eyes</b> are popular. </li>
(This is a compound subject with two elements.)
</ul>

In the last example, the compound subject is starting to get quite long. When a subject starts getting complicated, some writers like to show the end of the subject with a comma. Be aware that this is not a popular practice among many grammarians, but if you think it helps your reader, you can do it. For example: 

<ul>
<li> <b>Leaving a list of internet passwords, increasing your life insurance, and writing a will</b>, will give you peace of mind while you are on operations.</li>
(Here, the writer has used a comma after <i>will</i> to show the end of the subject. It is hard to argue that this comma does not help the reader.)
</ul>

<a href='../lessons/commas_with_a_long_subject.htm'>Read more about using a comma with a long subject</a>.


<h2>(8) Using Commas with Numbers</h2>


<center>
<img src="pics/commas_numbers.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas in numbers"/><br><br>
</center>

Commas can be used every 3 decimal places in large numbers to make them more readable. For example:

<ul>
<li> 3,356 <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li> 12,128,153,356 <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
<li> 175,757.01 <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

In Europe, the use of commas and full stops (<img src="../images/flag_uk.gif" />) / periods (<img src="../images/flag_us.gif" />) is reversed. So, in Europe, the numbers above would be written: 

<ul>
<li> 3.356 <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (in Europe)</li>
<li> 12.128.153.356 <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (in Europe)</li>
<li> 175.757,01 <img src="../images/tick.png" /> (in Europe)</li>
</ul>

<h2>(9) Using Commas before Speech Marks</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/commas_quotes.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas before quotations"/><br><br>
</center>

Words like <i>He said</i>, <i>She shouted</i>, <i>The author stated</i>, and <i>She wrote</i> often precede a quotation. A comma can be used after these words to separate them from the quotation. For example:

<ul>
<li>He said jokingly, "The world is my lobster."  <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>
<li>Paul whispered, "Is he always that miserable?" <img src="../images/tick.png" /> </li>

</ul>

Note: You don't have to use a comma. <a href="../lessons/quotation_(speech)_marks_colon_or_comma.htm">Using nothing and using a colon after the words that introduce a quotation</a> are also options.<br><br>

In fact, it's your choice whether you follow your introductory words with a comma, a colon, or nothing. It depends on your desired flow of text. If you don't really care about the desired flow of text and you'd like some guidelines to help you decide which to use, then there is a useful guideline which states that a comma should be used for short quotations (six words or fewer) and colon should be used for longer quotations. (This is not a rule. It's a useful guideline.)

<h2>(10) Using Commas with the Vocative Case</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/commas_vocative.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using commas for direct address"/><br><br>
</center>


When words are used to address somebody (or something) directly, those words are said to be in the <a href="../glossary/vocative_case.htm">vocative case</a>. In English, the vocative case is shown by offsetting it from the rest of the sentence with a comma (or commas if it's in the middle of the sentence).

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top: 30px;">More about Using Hyphens</h2>

A hyphen is a punctuation mark used as a joiner. A hyphen is typically used to join the separate parts of a compound word to make it clear that it's one entity. (A compound word is a word made up of more than one word.) 


<h2>(1) Using Hyphens in Compound Adjectives</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/hyphens_compound.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="hyphens in compound adjectives"/><br><br>
</center>

A hyphen joins the words in a <a href="../glossary/compound_adjectives.htm">compound adjective</a>. (A compound adjective is a single adjective made up of more than one word.) 

<ul>
<li> <span class="highlight">free-range</span> eggs <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> A <span class="highlight">eight-seater</span> taxi <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> A <span class="highlight">far-too-chatty</span> individual <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> <span class="highlight">six-foot</span> table <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> My <span class="highlight">single-minded</span> aim is to give existence to fantasy. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (American-Swedish sculptor Claes Oldenburg) </li>
<li> There's a difference between a free market and <span class="highlight">free-for-all</span> market. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Senator Bob Menendez)</li>

<h2>(2) Using Hyphens in Compound Nouns</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/hyphens_nouns.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="hyphens in compound nouns"/><br><br>
</center>


A hyphen can be used to join the words in a <a href="../glossary/compound_nouns.htm">compound noun</a>. (A compound noun is a single noun made up of more than one word. Some compound nouns are hyphenated.)

<ul>
<li> It needs a <span class="highlight">paper-clip</span> to hold the ticket in place. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> I am looking after a <span class="highlight">two-year-old</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> History is full of inevitable <span class="highlight">front-runners</span> who were inevitable until they weren't. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Politician Martin O'Malley)</li>
<li> Behind every successful man stands a surprised <span class="highlight">mother-in-law</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (French writer Voltaire)</li>
</ul>

Lots of compound nouns are unhyphenated (i.e., one word), and some are two words.

<ul>
<li> wheelchair <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> hot dog <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

<h2>(3) Using Hyphens in Prefixes</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/hyphens_prefix.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="hyphens in prefixes"/><br><br>
</center>

A hyphen can be used to join a <a href="../glossary/prefix.htm">prefix</a> to a word.

<ul>
<li> ultra-expensive <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> re-establish <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> co-opt <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

Most prefixed words are unhyphenated.

<ul>
<li> cooperate <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> defuse	<img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>	
</ul>

<h2>(4) Using Hyphens in Compound Verbs</h2>

A hyphen can be used to join the words in a <a href="../glossary/compound_verbs.htm">compound verb</a>, especially verbs formed from two nouns.

<ul>
<li> To gift-wrap <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> To ice-skate  <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> I was <span class="highlight">court-martialled</span> in my absence and sentenced to death in my absence, so I said they could shoot me in my absence. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Irish playwright Brendan Behan).</li>
</ul>

Compound verbs are far less common than compound adjectives and compound nouns. They are often invented by the writer to add a bit of flair.

<ul>
<li> She will <span class="highlight">eyebrow-beat</span> him into submission. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> He <span class="highlight">cold-shouldered</span> me when I was <span class="highlight">fist-pumping</span> his team mates. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>  
</ul>

Not all verbs comprising two words are hyphenated. Do not use a hyphen with a <a href="../glossary/phrasal_verbs.htm">phrasal verb</a> . (A phrasal verb comprises a main verb and another word, e.g., to break out, to drop off.)

<ul>
<li> Never give in, and never give up. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (American politician Hubert Humphrey)</li>
(These are phrasal verbs. They are correct without hyphens.)
</ul>

<a href="../glossary/compound_verbs.htm">Read more about compound verbs</a>.

<h2>(5) Using Hyphens in Fractions and Numbers Written in Full</h2>

Hyphens are used in fractions written out in full.

<ul>
<li> one-third <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> two-thirds <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> four-tenths <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

When numbers are written out in full, hyphens are used in all numbers between 21 and 99 (less those divisible by 10).

<ul>
<li> fifty-one <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> two hundred thirty-four <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> three thousand five hundred sixty-seven <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

You might be wondering why there's no "and" before "thirty-four" and "sixty-seven." It is a common practice to omit the word "and" (even though you might say it) because for many (especially Americans), "and" denotes a decimal point. In other words, some take "two hundred and twenty-one" as 200.21 not 221. (Interestingly, if you follow this practice and write out all the numbers, you'll reach 1000 before using the letter "a".)<br><br>

<a href="../lessons/numbers_how_to_write_in_full.htm">Read more about writing numbers in full</a>.

<h2>(6) Using Hyphens with List Items Sharing a Common Second Element</h2>

A hyphen can be used before a common second element in all but the last word in the list.

<ul>
<li> You can buy a two-, five- or seven-seater version of this car. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> If our monarchy can show democracy that leads to a two-, three-, four-party system (left, right and centre), then the Brotherhood will no longer be a contender.  <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Abdullah II of Jordan)</li>
</ul>

These three examples show this technique with compound adjectives that would ordinarily contain hyphens if written out in full. However, this technique can be used with compound words that wouldn't ordinarily contain hyphens.

<ul>
<li> I don't care if you're Aqua-, Bat- or Superman, Mr Clayderman. You're still late. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> It will increase two- or threefold. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
</ul>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Hyphens?</h2>

A hyphen is typically used to show that the joined words are a single entity (e.g., a single adjective or a single noun). This has the following three benefits:<br><br>

(1) It makes your text easier to read.<br>
(2) It removes the possibility for ambiguity.<br>
(3) It showcases your writing skills a little.<br><br>

Here are five noteworthy points related to hyphens.

<h2>(Point 1) Use a hyphen if the unhyphenated version of a compound adjective would be ambiguous.</h2>
British readers will expect you to use hyphens with compound adjectives, but, in the US, readers are more lenient. In fact, it is common to see compound adjectives without hyphens in both regions, especially with well-established terms that are unlikely to make a reader stall (e.g., "ice cream stall," "twentieth century building"). So, it is not a serious error to omit a hyphen from a compound adjective. That said though, when the unhyphenated version of a compound adjective is ambiguous, you must use a hyphen to link its words. 

<ul>
<li> a small business grant <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is ambiguous. Does this mean a small grant for business purposes or a grant for a small business?)
<li> a small-business grant <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(With the hyphen, it is clear that we're talking about a grant for a small business. It could be a large grant.)
</ul>

Here is another example:

<ul>
<li> I have a concealed weapons permit. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is ambiguous. Does this mean a permit for concealed weapons or a permit hidden from view?)
<li> I have a concealed-weapons permit. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(With the hyphen, it is clear we're talking about a permit for concealed weapons.)
</ul>

Here is another example:

<ul>
<li>a heavy water reactor <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is ambiguous. Is this a heavy reactor for use with water or a heavy-water reactor?)
(Note: "heavy water" is deuterium oxide.)
<li>a heavy-water reactor <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The hyphen makes it clear this is a deuterium-oxide reactor.)
</ul>



<h2>(Point 2) Don't use hyphens with adverbs that end "-ly."</h2>
When using an <a href="../lessons/adverbs.htm">adverb</a> to modify an <a href="../lessons/adjectives.htm">adjective</a> (e.g., "perfectly formed ring"), some writers feel the need to use a hyphen (e.g., "perfectly-formed ring"). With adverbs ending "-ly" (and there are lots) and the word "very," that's a mistake.

<ul>
<li> It is a <span class="highlight">wonderfully-decorated</span> tree. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
<li> Paula is a <span class="highlight">very-talented</span> student. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
</ul>

This applies only to adverbs ending "-ly." It does not apply to adjectives ending "-ly."

<ul>
<li> It's a <span class="highlight">friendly-looking</span>, family-run business. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
("Friendly" and "family" are not adverbs.) 
</ul>

Also, use a hyphen for adverbs that could feasibly be adjectives (e.g., "well," "fast," "best").

<ul>
<li> Lee is the <span class="highlight">best-known</span> player on the pitch. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Here, Lee is known better than any other player. "Best" is an adverb.)
<li> Lee is the best known player on the pitch. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Few would differentiate this from the hyphenated version, but it could feasibly mean that Lee is the best of all the known players, in which case "best" would be an adjective. If you substitute known with "chubby," it will highlight "best" as an adjective.)   
</ul>

This issue commonly crops up with the adverb "well," which is also an adjective meaning healthy. 

<ul>
<li> We're looking at a <span class="highlight">well-developed</span> fetus. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This means the fetus is significantly past the embryonic state.)
<li> We're looking at a <span class="highlight">well developed</span> fetus. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This could mean the same as above or possibly a healthy and developed fetus.)
</ul>

This situation occurs most commonly with "well" (e.g., "a well-fatted calf"), but it can occur with "fast" and "best" too (e.g., "fast-changing wind," "best-known actor").


<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>A Safe Rule</b></center><br><br>
This rule will see you right:<br><br>

Use a hyphen with "well" when it's modifying an adjective. The likelihood of needing the adjective "well" before another adjective is low.<br><br>(If you're not prepared to gamble on this low likelihood, substitute "well" with "healthy," and if your sentence makes no sense, put "well" back in and use a hyphen.)
</div>
</center>


<h2>(Point 3) When using an expression like "three-and-a-half," don't join your adjective to your noun with a hyphen.</h2>
When used as compound adjectives, expressions like "three-and-a-half" and "two-and-a-quarter" are often hyphenated to make it clear they're one entity. If you decide to use hyphens in such a term, don't join your adjective to your noun with a hyphen.

<ul>
<li> He wants <span class="highlight">four-and-a-quarter-billion</span>. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
<li> He wants <span class="highlight">four-and-a-quarter</span> billion. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Here, "four-and-a-quarter" is a compound adjective modifying the noun "billion." Joining them with a hyphen would be as wrong as writing "He wants a nice-car.")
</ul>


Be mindful, however, that your compound adjective might not end when the expression like "four-and-a-quarter" ends. 

<ul>
<li> He wants <span class="highlight">four-and-a-quarter-billion</span> pounds. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This time, the hyphen between "quarter" and "billion" is correct because "billion" is now part of the compound adjective modifying "pounds.")
</ul>

Be particularly careful to group all the parts of your compound adjective when writing ages.

<ul>
<li> She's a <span class="highlight">twenty-four-year-old</span> woman. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(All too often, the hyphen after "year" is mistakenly omitted.)
</ul>

<h2>(Point 4) Use your spellchecker smartly to spell compound nouns correctly.</h2>
Some <a href="../glossary/compound_nouns.htm">compound nouns</a> are one word (e.g., "snowman," "aircraft"), some are two words (e.g., "fish tank," "cell phone"), some compound nouns are hyphenated (e.g., "know-how," "runner-up"), and some have more than one acceptable spelling (e.g., "paper clip," "paper-clip," and "paperclip").<br><br>

Your spellchecker will not test the two-word version or the hyphenated version as a single entity. In other words, it will not highlight "air craft" or "air-craft" as an error (even though it should be "aircraft"). So, you have to test the one-word version. If your spellchecker doesn't like the one-word version, you have a choice between the two-word version and the hyphenated version. Often, this really is your choice. Use a hyphen for clarity (i.e., to make it instantly obvious it's a single entity) and to eliminate ambiguity.

<ul>
<li> pen friend / pen-friend </li>
(The hyphenated version is clearer. It stands out as a single entity, making it easier to read.)
<li> cooking oil / cooking-oil </li> 
(The hyphenated version makes it clear the oil is not cooking.) 
</ul>

<h2>(Point 5) Use your spellchecker and your instinct to determine whether to use a hyphen with a prefix.</h2>
If you're unsure whether to use a hyphen with a prefix, start by not using a hyphen. However, use a hyphen if the unhyphenated version:

<ul>
<li> Looks too unwieldy for your taste ("antiaircraft" might be an example).
<li> Is highlighted as a spelling mistake by your spellchecker (e.g., "reestablish").
<li> Is ambiguous (e.g., "Re-cover the sofa" is not ambiguous, but "Recover the sofa" is.)
</ul>

Each entry starts with a simple explanation and basic examples before moving to real-life, entertaining examples. All entries conclude with a section highlighting why the grammar point is relevant for a writer and top-level bullet points summarizing the entry. If you like Grammar Monster, you'll love this book.

<b>(1) To insert additional information into text.</b>

	<ul>
	<li>The stegosaurus (the best-known herbivorous dinosaur) had a brain the size of a ping pong ball. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	(The additional information is usually an expansion or clarification of whatever preceded or an afterthought.)
	</ul>

<b>(2) To introduce an abbreviation.</b>

	<ul>
	<li> Neil Armstrong was selected to join the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1962.  <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>

	</ul>

<br><br>

<img src="pics/punctuation_square_brackets.png" align="left" style="margin: -10px 10px 0 0;"/> Square brackets have two main uses:<br><br>
 
<b>(1) To show that text in a quotation did not feature in the original.</b><br><br>



<ul>
<li>(1a) Square brackets can be used to explain something in a quotation.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> <b>Original quotation</b>: "It is a contradiction in terms."</li>
	<li> <b>Amended</b>: "It [military intelligence] is a contradiction in terms." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	</ul>

<li>(1b) Square brackets can be used to modify a quotation.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> <b>Original quotation</b>: "It is a contradiction in terms."</li>
	<li> <b>Amended</b>: "[Military intelligence] is a contradiction in terms." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	</ul>


<li>(1c) Square brackets can be used to replace unnecessary text with [...] (called <a href="../glossary/ellipsis.htm">an ellipsis</a>).</li>
	<ul>
	<li> <b>Original quotation</b>: "I don't want any yes-men around me. I want everybody to tell me the truth even if it costs them their jobs." </li>
	<li> <b>Reduced</b>: "I don't want any yes-men around me [...] even if it costs them their jobs." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	</ul>

</ul>


<b>(2) To show that text in a quotation did feature in the original.</b>

	<ul>
	<li> In your statement, you wrote: "I appraised [sic] him of the situation at about 4 o'clock." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	(This should be "apprised" not "appraised." The term <i>sic</i> is short for <i>sic erat scriptum</i> ("thus it was written").)

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top: 50px;">More about Using Parentheses (Round Brackets)</h2>
 
 
<h2>(1) Using Round Brackets to Insert Additional Information into Text</h2>


<center>
<img src="pics/brackets_round.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="parentheses (brackets) for additional information" /><br><br>
</center>



Here are some more examples of using round brackets to insert additional information into text. (The additional information is usually an expansion or clarification of whatever preceded or an afterthought.)

<ul>
<li> The stegosaurus (a genus of herbivorous thyreophoran dinosaur) was predated by the allosaurus. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The round brackets insert an expansion.)
<li> The stegosaurus (the herbivore with tiles on its back and a spikey tail) weighed the same as a car. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The round brackets insert a clarification.)
<li> The plates on a stegosaurus's back were for display. (It is unlikely they had a thermoregulatory function like an elephant's ears.)<img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The round brackets insert an afterthought.)
</ul>

The additional information inside the brackets is called a <a href="../glossary/parenthesis.htm">parenthesis</a>. A parenthesis can be removed without any loss of meaning.

<h2>(2) Using Round Brackets to Introduce an Abbreviation</h2>

If there's a chance your readers might not be familiar with an abbreviation, write it out in full the first time it's used and put the abbreviation in brackets afterwards. This is a standard practice in business and academic writing.

<ul>
<li> The Master of Business Administration (MBA) teaches approaches to business management. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

<h2>(3) Using Round Brackets to Show a Plural Option</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/brackets_plural.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="parentheses (brackets) to show plural option" /><br><br>
</center>




For brevity, round brackets can be used to show a plural option. 

<ul>
<li>Remove the sheet(s) so the air can flow freely <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This avoids "sheet or sheets.")
<li> Please append the name of your guest(s) to the list. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
(This avoids "guest or guests.")
</ul>

When using brackets to show a plural option, it could start getting complicated if you provided an option with everything that ought to change.  

<ul>
<li> Ensure the rod(s) is(are) aligned with the top section. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is untidy.)
<li> The routine uses the output(s) of that(those) process(es). <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is almost unreadable.)
</ul>

The normal practice is to use (s) with just the key word and to treat everything else as singular.

<ul>
<li> The routine uses output of that process(es). <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
</ul>
 
In a similar way, round brackets can be used to present two ideas at once. This is usually done for a bit of fun.

<ul>
<li> Bring your A game on Monday. We're going to crack Mission (Im)possible. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
<li> I'm calling it an (experi)mental project. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
</ul> 
 
<h2>Why Should I Care about Round Brackets?</h2>

There are three noteworthy issues with brackets.

<h2>(Issue 1) Brackets are considered informal.</h2>
Brackets are a great way to add additional information because they're easy to spot. This means they won't disrupt reading flow. There's a problem though. Brackets are considered informal, and lots of businesses and universities do not permit their use in formal documents. Don't worry. There's a solution. Using brackets is just one of your options for inserting additional information. You can also use <a href="using_commas.htm">commas</a> or <a href="using_dashes.htm">dashes</a>. 

<ul>
<li> The stegosaurus, the best-known herbivorous dinosaur, had a brain the size of a ping pong ball. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
(Commas are an alternative to round brackets.)
<li> The stegosaurus – the iconic dinosaur that lived 150 million years ago – had a top speed of 5 mph. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
(Dashes are another alternative to round brackets.) 
</ul>

Be aware that brackets trump commas and dashes when used like this:

<ul>
<li> A large stegosaurus could be 9 metres (29.5 feet) long and weigh 7 tons (15,432 pounds). <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
(Everyone permits brackets for this purpose.)
</ul>

	<center>
	<div class="messageBox warning">
	<center><b>You Can Use Brackets, Commas, or Dashes</b></center><br><br>
	Even though they are useful for introducing information to make your writing clearer, round brackets can make your work look a little informal or disorganised. In formal correspondence, you should try to limit their use.

	Don't forget though, brackets are just one type of <a href="../glossary/parentheses_parenthetical_punctuation.htm">parenthetical punctuation</a>.<br><br>
	Commas and dashes are options too. For example:

	<ul>

<h2>(Issue 2) Uncertainty over whether a period goes inside or outside the close bracket.</h2>
The big question with brackets is where to put the end punctuation, which is usually a period (full stop). Does it go inside or outside the brackets?<br><br>
When using brackets, the positioning of end punctuation follows logic. Sometimes it goes outside the close bracket, and sometimes it goes inside. For example:

<ul>
<li> She will ride a pony. (However, she will not ride a Dartmoor pony.) <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The period belongs to the full sentence in the brackets.)
<li> She will ride a pony (but not a Dartmoor pony). <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The period belongs to the main sentence, not to the text in the brackets.)
<li> She will ride a pony (she told me yesterday) but not a Dartmoor pony. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The text inside the brackets (i.e., the parenthesis) is a standalone sentence within another sentence. When this happens, you should, for readability, start the parenthesis with a lowercase letter and omit the period.)
</ul>


Things can get quirky with <a href="../glossary/question-marks.htm">question marks</a> and <a href="../glossary/exclamation_marks.htm">exclamation marks</a> because you might need to double up on end punctuation. The principle is the same: end punctuation follows logic.

<ul>
<li> The group paid with a stolen credit card (my credit card!). <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The exclamation mark belongs with my credit card, and the full stop ends the whole sentence.) 
<li> The group paid with a stolen credit card (didn't you lose your card?). <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The question mark belongs with the bracketed question, while the full stop ends the sentence.) 
</ul>


<h2>(Issue 3) Uncertainty with capital letters when expanding an abbreviation.</h2>
When introducing an abbreviation, there's nothing to think about if the abbreviation represents the name of something (i.e., a proper noun). In other words, the expanded version is written with capital letters.

<ul>
<li> The motto for the Federal Bureaux of Investigation (FBI) is "fidelity, bravery, integrity". <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul> 
 
If your abbreviation does not represent a proper noun, you must decide whether to use capital letters. 

<ul>
<li> Food crops are the most controversial genetically modified organism (GMO).</li>
(The full version of the abbreviation isn't immediately obvious.)
<li> The term Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) was popularized by the media not scientists. </li>
(The capital letters aren't justifiable under capitalization rules, but the definition of the abbreviation now stands out.) 
</ul>

So, each option has a pro and a con. If the institution you're writing for does not offer any guidelines on whether to go "caps" or "non-caps" in such cases, then pick a method and be consistent. (If you go for the "non-caps" option, you'll have far fewer pedants on your case.)

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 3em;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li> Brackets are a great way to insert additional information (called a parenthesis).</li>
<li> You can insert additional information using commas or dashes if you think brackets are too informal.</li>
<li> The placement of end punctuation with a close bracket follows logic (like this). (It just follows logic.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top: 50px;">More about Using Square Brackets</h2>


<h2>(1) Using Square Brackets to Show That Text in a Quotation Was Not in the Original.</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/brackets_square.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="square brackets to explain quotations" /><br><br>
</center>


<b>Square Brackets to Explain Something in a Quotation</b><br><br>

In these examples, the original text is intact, but an explanation is inserted using square brackets. 

<ul>
<li> "Most people save all their lives and leave it [their money] to somebody else." (Actress Hedy Lamarr) <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> "It [electricity] is really just organized lightning." (Comedian George Carlin) <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
</ul>

Square brackets tell your readers that the bracketed text did not feature in the original.<br><br>

<b>Using Square Brackets to Modify a Quotation</b><br><br>

In the next examples, the original text has been modified. The words that needed explaining have been replaced with the explanations.

<ul>
<li> "Most people save all their lives and leave [their money] to somebody else." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> "[Electricity] is really just organized lightning." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

This technique can also be used to tweak the words in a quotation to ensure it aligns with your text.

<ul>
<li> Angela Merkel believes "it's [her] damn duty and obligation to do everything possible for Europe to find a united path." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The original quotation was "It's my damn duty….")
<li> Quoting author Flannery O'Connor, Jason often reminded his children that "[t]he truth [did] not change according to [their] ability to stomach it." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The original quotation was "The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it".)
</ul>

Typically, aligning a quotation means changing a pronoun (e.g., "my"2 to "his") or changing a verb tense (e.g., "does" to "did"). Some people also like to show that a capital letter has been changed to a lowercase letter, as in the second example. (That's a bit much, <a href="https://www.cyberdefinitions.com/definitions/IMHO.html">IMHO</a>.) If you find yourself tweaking other types of words, be careful not to change the intended meaning of the quotation. Also, if you find yourself over-tweaking, try to revert to the original quotation.

<ul>
<li> Alice Cooper famously said that "from the moment [he] leave[s] [his] house or hotel room, the public owns [him]." <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is a mess.)
<li> Alice Cooper famously said: "From the moment I leave my house or hotel room, the public owns me." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This is much tidier.)
</ul>

<b>Using Square Brackets to Replace Unnecessary Text</b><br><br>

<center>
<img src="pics/brackets_threedots.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="square brackets with ellipsis (three dots)" /><br><br>
</center>

Three dots (called <a href="../glossary/ellipsis.htm">ellipsis</a>) are often used to show that text has been omitted from a quotation. An ellipsis punctuation mark is written "..." or "[...]". 

<ul>
<li> Education is the most powerful weapon […] to change the world. (President Nelson Mandela) <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The ellipsis replaces the words "which you can use".)
<li> Andy Warhol is the only genius […] with an IQ of 60. (US author Gore Vidal) <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The ellipsis replaces the words "I've ever known".)
</ul>

<h2>(1) Using Square Brackets to Show That Text in a Quotation Was in the Original.</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/brackets_sic.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="square brackets with sic" /><br><br>
</center>

<b>Using Square Brackets with [sic]</b><br><br>

The term "[sic]" shows that the preceding text featured in the original quotation. Often, "[sic]" is used to indicate that a writing error was committed by the original author. 

<ul>
<li> He claimed his statement was "appropriate and did not undermine the moral [sic] of our troops." </li> 
(It should be morale not moral.)
</ul>

[sic] is the opening word of "sic erat scriptum" (Latin for "thus was it written"). It is not an <a href="../glossary/acronyms.htm">acronym</a> meaning "said in copy" or "spelling is correct." Therefore, [s.i.c.] is wrong. [sic] is not solely used for highlighting writing errors. It can be used to highlight unusual word usage (e.g., <a href="../glossary/archaisms.htm">archaisms</a>, dialectic language), surprising facts or facts known to be wrong. 


<h2>Why Should I Care about Square Brackets?</h2>

<h2>(Reason 1) Square brackets allow you fit quotations snugly into your work.</h2>
<a href="../glossary/quotation.htm">Quotations</a> are a great way to incorporate information from other sources into your writing, and they are particularly useful for supporting arguments. Quotations carry a sense honesty and believability. They're like an impartial vote for your assertion. You can use square brackets to trim quotations fit snugly into your writing. So, chop and change away, but remember not to change the intended meaning. 

<h2>(Reason 2) Slam someone with [sic].</h2>
If you're ever the recipient of antagonistic correspondence that contains a writing error, you could use [sic] to slam the sender for their error.

<ul>
<li> <b>Antagonist</b>: I am not adverse to change, but I will not be voting for your proposal.</li>
<li> <b>You</b>: I'm pleased you're not adverse [sic] to change because my proposal has been approved.</li>
(The antagonist should have used "averse." Using [sic] this way fairly aggressive. Use sparingly.)
</ul>

<h2>Using Quotation Marks</h2>

Quotation marks ("") have four uses:<br><br>

<b>(1) To identify previously spoken or written words.</b>

<ul>
<li> Groucho Marx said: "Either he's dead or my watch has stopped." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

<b>(2) To highlight the name of things like ships, books, and plays.</b>

<ul>
<li> When the "Herald of Free Enterprise" left the port with her bow-door open, the sea flooded her decks almost instantly. Within minutes, she was lying on her side in shallow water.  <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

<b>(3) To signify so-called or alleged.</b>

<ul>
<li> When the boss left, Peter's "mentor" took off his uniform and rushed back to the pub. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li> 
</ul>

<b>(4) To show that a word refers to the word itself not the word's meaning.</b>

<ul>
<li> "Dogs" is plural. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>
  
Quotation marks are also known as speech marks, quotes, and inverted commas.

<h2>(1) Using Quotation Marks to Identify Previously Spoken or Written Words</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/speech_marks_exact_spoken_or_written_words.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using quotation marks" /><br><br>
</center>

Here are some examples of quotation marks used to identify previously spoken or written words.

<ul>
<li> George Bernard Shaw said: "When a thing is funny, search it carefully for a hidden truth." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(When a quotation is introduced with words like "He said" (called words of attribution), it is usual to precede the quotation with a comma or a colon.)
<li> Your uncle's observation wasn't meant to be just funny. Take Shaw's advice and "search it carefully for a hidden truth." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(When there are no words of attribution, do not use a comma or a colon.)
</ul>

<h2>(2) Using Quotation Marks to Highlight the Name of Things Like Ships, Books, and Plays</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/speech_marks_ships.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using quotation marks for the names of ships or plays" /><br><br>
</center>

 
Here are some examples of quotation marks used to highlight the names of things like ships, planes, books, and plays.

<li> "Britannic", which was bigger than its sister ship "Titanic," was sunk in 1916 after a mine-strike. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
<li> "Southern Stars" was Jones's account of the trek. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The quotation marks aid reading because <i>Stars</i> is a plural word and <i>was</i> is singular.) <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> Howard Hughes hated the name "Spruce Goose" for his flying boat, which was made of birch. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(The quotation marks quote journalists, signify so-called, and highlight the plane's name.)
</ul>

<h2>(3) Using Quotation Marks to Signify <i>So-Called</i> or <i>Alleged</i></h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/speech_marks_alleged.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using quotation marks to denote so-called or alleged" /><br><br>
</center>

Here are some examples of quotation marks used to signify <a href="../glossary/irony.htm">irony</a> (in the form of sarcasm) or <i>so-called</i> or <i>alleged</i>. 

<ul>
<li> My "mates" drove off with my clothes. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> Using his father's equipment, Alexander found over 50,000 bacteria on a "clean" chopping board. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> His "wife" arrived 2 hours after Mr. Becket checked in. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Sometimes, quotation marks perform two roles. Here, they signify so-called or alleged, but they also suggest that Mr. Becket himself described the lady as his wife.)
</ul>

Quotation marks are also used to recognize that a word is not being used in its <a href="../glossary/literal_meaning.htm">literal sense</a>.

<ul>
<li> Oh no, I've dropped another. These eggs "know" when you're about to crack them. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li> 
(The eggs don't know. Here, the quotation marks show that "know" is not being used in its literal sense.)
</ul>

<h2>(4) Using Quotation Marks to Show a Word Refers to the Word Itself</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/speech_marks_to_refer_to_a_word.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="using quotation marks to refer to a word" /><br><br>
</center>

Here are some examples of quotation marks used to show that a word is not being used for its meaning. (This is more commonly done using italics.)

<ul>
<li> "It's" is a contraction of "it is" or "it has". It's got no other uses. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(In the first sentence, <i>It's</i> is not being used for its meaning. We're discussing it. In the second, the <i>It's</i> is being used for its meaning.)
<li> 	If you apply the Latin rule for forming a plural, then the plural of "octopus" is "octopi." However, "octopus" stems from Greek not Latin. If you apply the Greek rule, it's "octopodes," but even a Greek wouldn't use "octopodes" because the Greek word for octopus is "chtapodi." The plural of "octopus" is "octopuses." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Quotation marks can start to get scruffy. Italics are far neater.)
</ul>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top:30px;">More about Quotation Marks</h2>

<h2>Why Should I Care about Quotation Marks?</h2>
There are five common issues related to quotation marks.


<h2>(Issue 1) Being inconsistent with single or double quotation marks.</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/speech_marks_doubles.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="double or single quotation/speech marks"/><br><br>
</center>

Quotation marks come in two forms: singles ('like these') and doubles ("like these"). The most common convention is to use doubles. When using doubles, you should use singles to nest a quotation within another quotation. For example:

<ul> 
<li> She said: "My dog can say 'sausages' more clearly than the one on TV."<img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> Homer Simpson said: "Maybe, just once, someone will call me 'Sir' without adding 'you're making a scene.'"<img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

Some writers (far more in the UK than in the US) consider double quotation marks too stark, and they like to start with singles and nest doubles within them. For example:

<ul>
<li> She said: 'My dog can say "sausages" more clearly than the one on TV.' <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

There's a lot of leniency on this. The only agreed rule is that singles and doubles should not be mixed at the same level. For example:

<ul>
<li> My dog may not be able to add up, spell my name or say "sausages" or "Esther" like the ones you see on 'That's Life', but he can hold his own in a fight with a badger. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is untidy. Doubles and singles have been mixed at the same level.)
</ul>

There are two more quirks. It's not uncommon for writers to use singles to denote <i>alleged</i> or <i>so-called</i> to differentiate the word from quoted speech. It's also common to see singles around individual letters because doubles look too stark.

<ul>
<li> The 'fresh' scallops ponged a bit and were pretty slimy. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> There's no 'a' in "definite". No, really, there isn't. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

Here are some more examples:

<ul>
<li>The website states: "After 30 years, the 'Mary Rose' now has a permanent home in her new, state-of-the-art museum." <img src="../images/tick.png " /></li>
(The "Mary Rose" was a warship of the English Tudor navy of King Henry VIII.) 
<li>She said: "I don't need 'friends' like you." <img src="../images/tick.png " /></li>
(Here, <i>friends</i> is within speech marks to convey the idea of <i>so-called friends</i>, which would have been expressed with voice tone.)
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 2) Using quotation marks with reported speech</h2>
Quotation marks are not used for reported speech. (Reported speech is usually preceded by the word <i>that</i>.) Only use quotation marks for actual quotations of speech or writing.

<ul>
<li> The secretary said that "the phones were dead." <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is reported speech. The quotation marks do not accurately quote the secretary, who said, "The phones are dead.")
<li> The secretary said that the phones were dead. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This is also reported speech. It is correct without quotation marks.)
<li> The secretary said that the phones were "dead." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This is also reported speech, but this time the quotation marks are fine because they quote the secretary accurately.)
<li> The secretary said, "The phones are dead." <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(This is not reported speech. The quotation marks show the secretary's actual speech.)
</ul>

Here is another example:

<ul>
<li> This morning, Alan said that he liked toast. <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li> 
(This is an example of reported speech, which is why no quotation marks have been used.)
<li> This morning, Alan said that "he liked toast." <img src="../images/cross.png" /></li> 
(As these are not the actual words Alan said, there should be no quotation marks.
<li> Alan said, "I like toast." <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(These are his exact words.)
</ul>


<h2>(Issue 3) Being unsure whether to use a comma or a colon before a quotation.</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/speech_marks_punctuation_before.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="the punctuation before quotation/speech marks"/><br><br>
</center>



When introducing a quotation with words like "She whispered" or "It stated" (called words of attribution), you have to decide whether to follow the introduction with a comma, a colon, or nothing. In creative writing, writers are free to choose between a comma, a colon, or nothing to achieve their desired flow of text. In more formal writing, punctuation is expected after an introduction for a quotation. The rules (below) are quite lax, and they overlap, giving you a choice.<br><br>

<b>(Rule 1) Use a colon if the introduction is an independent clause.</b>

<ul>
<li> New York gang members all advise the following: "Don't run from fat cops. They shoot earlier."</li> 
</ul>

Often, using "the following" helps to create an <a href="../glossary/independent_clause.htm">independent clause</a> (i.e., one that could stand alone as a <a href="../glossary/sentences.htm">sentence</a>). If you've used a colon, go for a capital letter to start your quotation.<br><br>

<a href="colons_capitalization_after_a_colon.html">Read more about capitalization after a colon</a>.<br>
<a href='../lessons/quotation_(speech)_marks_colon_or_comma.htm'>Read more about colons or commas before quotations</a>.<br><br>

<b>(Rule 2) You can use a colon if the quotation is a complete sentence.</b><br><br>

You could opt for a colon if the quotation itself is a complete sentence, especially if you intend to start it with a capital letter. 

<ul>
<li> The orders state: "In case of fire, exit the building before tweeting about it."</li>
(You could also use a comma here.)
</ul>

<b>(Rule 3) Use a comma if the introduction is not an independent clause.</b><br><br>
You should go for a comma if the introduction is not an independent clause.

<ul>
<li> Before each shot, the keeper said aloud, "bum, belly, beak, bang."</li>  
(Use a comma if the introduction is not an independent clause and the quotation is not a sentence.)
<li> Peering over his glasses, he said, "Never test the depth of a river with both feet."</li> 
(You could also use a colon here because the quotation is a complete sentence.)
</ul>

<b>(Rule 4) You can only use a comma after a quotation.</b><br><br>
Only a comma can be used <b>after</b> a quotation.

<ul>
<li> "Always give 100%, unless you're donating blood", he would always say.</li>
(A colon is not an option. The question of whether the comma should be inside or outside the quotation mark is covered on Issue 4 below.)
</ul>

<b>(Rule 5) Don't use any punctuation if the quotation is not introduced.</b><br><br>
It is common for quotations to be used without introductions. When there's no introduction, don't use any punctuation.

<ul>
<li> I believe there really is, "no place like home."</li>
(There should be no comma.) 
<li> I would hate to see the worst if this is the, "best skiing resort in France".</li>
</ul>

<h2>(Issue 4) Being unsure whether to place punctuation inside or outside the quotation.</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/speech_marks_inside.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="comma or period inside quotation/speech marks"/><br><br>
</center>



Brits and Americans tend to follow different rules when deciding whether a comma or period (full stop) should live inside or outside a quotation and whether to double up with end punctuation. It's not uncommon to find Brits following the so-called US convention. Here is a summary:

<table>
<tr><th>Punctuation</th><th>UK Convention</th><th>US Convention</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>. and ,
</td>
<td>
Place your full stops and commas outside (unless they appear in the original).

<ul>
<li> "Sick", to today’s youth, means "excellent".</li> 
<li> "The price of greatness", said Churchill, "is responsibility."</li>
(The full stop is in the original.)
</ul>
</td>
<td>
Place your full stops and commas inside.
<ul>
<li> "Sick," to today’s youth, means "excellent."</li>
<li> "The price of greatness," said Churchill, "is responsibility."</li>
</ul>

Obviously, don’t put your comma inside if it precedes the quotation (like the one after Churchill).
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>! and ?
</td>
<td colspan="2">
Place exclamation marks and question marks inside or outside according to logic.

<ul>
<li> Did he say, "I love you"?</li> 
("I love you" is not a question, but the whole sentence is.)
<li> He shouted, "Do you love me?"</li>
(The whole sentence is not a question, but the quotation is.)
</ul>

The second example is not a question, but it ends in a question mark. For neatness, it's acceptable to use just one end mark. Under US convention, you should use only one end mark. Under the UK convention and if you're a real logic freak, you can use two end marks.<br><br>

<ul>
<li> He shouted, "Do you love me?".</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
?, !, and .
</td>
<td>
Don't double up with end marks. But, if you must, you can.

<ul>
<li> Did he ask, "Do you love me?"?</li> 
(This is unwieldy but acceptable. The sentence is a question, and the quotation is a question.)<br><br>
<li> He shouted, "Do you love me?".</li>
(This is unwieldy but acceptable.)
</ul>
</td>

<td>
Don't double up with end marks.

<ul>
<li> Did she really ask, "Do you love me?"? <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(This is too unwieldy for US tastes.)
<li> Did she really ask, "Do you love me?"</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>
: and ;
</td>
<td colspan="2">
Place colons and semicolons outside the quotation.

<ul>
<li> Samuel Johnson offered three literal definitions for the word <span class="highlight">"slave":</span> one mancipated to a master, not a free-man and a dependant. Johnson offered a fourth definition, <span class="highlight">"the lowest form of life";</span> however, he stated that this definition was only used proverbially.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
More on ?, ! and .
</td>
<td colspan="2">
Don't end a quotation with a period (full stop) when the quotation doesn't end the whole sentence. There's more leniency with question and exclamation marks, but try to avoid that situation too.

<li>"I'm free." he'd say. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>

<h2>(Issue 5) Using quotation marks for emphasis.</h2>
Don't use quotation marks for emphasis. Firstly, it's not a recognized use for quotation marks, and, secondly, your readers could read them as meaning <i>alleged</i> or <i>so-called</i>.

<ul>
<li> We sell "fresh" fish. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
<li> Welcome to a "clean" Western restaurant. <img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>
(These are both real examples.)
</ul>


<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 3em;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li> Nest single quotation marks within doubles.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> The instructions say: "Shout 'Yahtzee' loudly."</li>
	</ul>
<li> Don't put reported speech in quotation marks.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> He said that "he did shout it loudly."<img src="../images/cross.png"/></li>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top:30px;">One More Point about Quotation Marks</h2>

<h2>Using Ellipsis (Three Dots) in a Quotation</h2>
<center>
<img src="pics/speech_marks_ellipsis.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="ellipsis within a quotation"/><br><br>
</center>

You can use three dots (called <i>ellipsis</i>) to show that you have omitted part of a quotation. For example:

<ul>
<li> <b>Original</b>: " I'm never going to be famous. My name will never be writ large on the roster of Those Who Do Things. I don't do anything. Not one single thing. I used to bite my nails, but I don't even do that anymore."  (Dorothy Parker, 1893-1967) </li>  
<li>  <b>With ellipsis</b>:  "I'm never going to be famous...I don't do anything...I used to bite my nails, but I don't even do that anymore."  (Dorothy Parker, 1893-1967) </li>  
</ul>

Note: Quite often, the ellipsis is placed between <a href="../lessons/brackets_square_brackets.htm">square brackets</a>.<br><br>

<h2>Using Dashes</h2>

Dashes have five uses:<br><br>

<b>(1) To show ranges (e.g., with times and dates).</b>

	<ul>
	<li>World War II ran <span class="highlight">1939&ndash;1945</span>. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	</ul>

<b>(2) To divide the equal parts of a two-part adjective.</b>

	<ul>
	<li>The <span class="highlight">London&ndash;Paris </span> flight is cancelled. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	</ul>

<b>(3) To extend a sentence.</b>

	<ul>
	<li>It depends on one thing &mdash; trust. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	(In this example, the dash has been used like a <a href="using_colons.htm">colon</a>.) 
	<li>It depends on trust &mdash; it always has. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	(Here, the dash has been used like a <a href="using_semicolons.htm">semicolon</a>.)
	<li>It needed &mdash; trust. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
	(Here, the dash has been used like an <a href="../glossary/ellipsis.htm">ellipsis</a> (three dots).)
	</ul>

<b>(4) To mark a parenthesis (e.g., an afterthought or a clarification).</b>

	<ul>
	<li>It depends &mdash; as my mother used to say &mdash;  on trust.</li>
	(In this example, the dashes have been used <a href="using_commas.htm">commas</a> or <a href="../glossary/brackets.htm">parentheses, i.e., brackets</a>.)
	</ul>


<b>(5) To credit a quotation.</b>

	<ul>
	<li>"Love is a serious mental disease." &mdash; Plato </li>

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top: 30px;">More about Dashes</h2>

<h2>Dashes Are Usually an Option, Not a Necessity</h2>
For the most part, the dash does not have a unique role in grammar. It is usually used as an alternative to another <a href="../glossary/punctuation.htm">punctuation mark</a>.<br><br>

When used <a href="../lessons/extend_a_sentence.htm">to extend a sentence</a>, a dash can replace a <a href="using_semicolons.htm">semicolon</a> (;), a <a href="using_colons.htm">colon</a> (:), or <a href="../glossary/ellipsis.htm">three dots (...) used as a pause for effect</a>.<br><br>

When used as parentheses, <a href='../lessons/parenthesis_choice_of_parentheses.htm'>dashes are alternatives to brackets or commas</a>.

<h2>The Types of Dash</h2>
There are two types of dash: the <i>em dash</i> (&mdash;) and the <i>en dash</i> (&ndash;).<br><br>


The <i>em dash</i> is the same length as the character "M" (uppercase), and the <i>en dash</i> is same length as the letter "n" (lowercase).<br><br>

As dashes do not feature on a standard keyboard, lots of people use hyphens instead of dashes.  That's not such a crime, but it's something of a missed opportunity to show off that you know the difference between a hyphen and a dash. Some writers like to use two hyphens (--) to represent one dash to differentiate.<br><br>

Here are the four main dash-like characters ordered longest to shortest: <br>

<table class="gridtable">
<tr>
<th>Name</th><th>Punctuation</th><th>How To Get One</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>em dash</td><td>&mdash;</td>
<td>Ctl + Alt + minus (on the numeric pad)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>minus sign</td><td>&minus;</td>
<td>minus (on the numeric pad)</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>en dash</td><td>&ndash;</td>
<td>Ctl + minus (on the numeric pad)</tr>

<tr>
<td>hyphen</td><td>-</td>
<td>- (the key to the right of "0")</td>
</tr>

</table>

The hyphen and the <i>en dash</i> are almost indistinguishable from each other when using normal size fonts.

<h2 class="text-centred" style="margin-top: 30px;">More about Using Dashes</h2>

<h2>(1) Using Dashes with Ranges (e.g., Times and Dates)</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/dashes_dates.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="dashes used with times and dates"/><br><br>
</center>

A dash can be used between times and dates. (A dash will usually replace the words <i>from...to</i> or <i>between...and</i>.) For example:

<ul>
<li>USSR existed 1922&ndash;1991.</li>
</ul>

Note: This is an alternative to the following:

<ul>
<li> USSR existed between 1922 and 1991.</li>
<li> USSR existed from 1922 to 1991.</li>
<li> USSR existed 1922 to 1991.</li>
</ul>

Here are some more examples of using dashes with ranges.

<ul>
<li>The project will be delivered January&ndash;June.</li>
<li>I will visit 13 January&ndash;24 January</li>
<li>I will visit 0800&ndash;0900.</li>
</ul>

Using a dash in a range is particularly common in tables. For example:<br>

<table class="gridtable">
<tr><th>Time</th><th>Event</th></tr>
<tr><td>0800&ndash;0830</td><td>Introduction</td></tr>
<tr><td>0830&ndash;0930</td><td>Lesson 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>0930&ndash;1230</td><td>Lessons 2&ndash;3</td></tr>
</table>

<br>

<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>The Values in the Range Are Inclusive</b></center><br><br>
When using dashes between ranges, the values are inclusive. For example:

<ul>
<li>The Great Fire of London took place 2&ndash;6 September 1666.</li>
(As the values are inclusive, the fire lasted 5 days.)
</ul>


</div>
</center>




Note: If you're a stickler for the rules, use an <i>en dash</i> between times and dates. You will get away with a hyphen. Do not use an <i>em dash</i>.


<h2>(2) Using Dashes in Compound Adjectives with Equal Parts</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/dashes_compound_adjective.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="dashes in two-part adjectives"/><br><br>
</center>

A dash can replace a hyphen in a <a href="../glossary/compound_adjective.htm">compound adjective</a> with two equal elements. For example:

<ul>
<li>The India-Pakistan issue</li>
<li>The NATO-Warsaw Pact agreement </li>
</ul>

Note: If you're a stickler for the rules, use an <i>en dash</i> in your adjective. You will get away with a hyphen. Do not use an <i>em dash</i>.


<h2>(3) Using Dashes to Extend Sentences</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/dashes_extend.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="dashes to replace semicolons, colons, or ellipses"/><br><br>
</center>

<b>Using a dash to replace a colon</b><br><br>

A dash can be used to replace a colon that offers more information about something previously mentioned in the sentence. For example:

<ul>
<li> She demanded just one thing from her students: effort. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> She demanded just one thing from her students &mdash; effort. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

In the two sentences above, the word "effort" is known as an <a href="../glossary/appositive_apposition.htm">appositive</a>. An appositive renames something. Here, the appositive renames "one thing.") Here is another example:

<ul>
<li>It is by the fortune of God that we have three benefits — freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the wisdom never to use either. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Mark Twain's original quotation uses a colon. The appositive is "freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and the wisdom never to use either." It renames "three benefits.")
</ul>

<b>Using a dash to replace a semicolon</b><br><br>


A dash can be used to replace a semicolon that replaces a period (full stop) to give a smoother transition between two sentences:
For example:

<ul>
<li> She demanded effort from her students. That's all she ever asked for. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> She demanded effort from her students; that's all she ever asked for. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(A semicolon gives a smoother transition between the sentences.)
<li> She demanded effort from her students &mdash; that's all she ever asked for. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(Here, the semicolon has been replaced by an <i>em dash</i>.)
</ul>

<b>Using a dash to replace an ellipsis (i.e., three dots)</b><br><br>

A dash can be used to replace three dots used as a pause for effect. For example:

<ul>
<li> As she prodded through the sludge, something caught her eye. It was the unblemished unmistakable sparkle of ... the diamond on her grandmother's ring. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
<li> As she prodded through the sludge, something caught her eye. It was the unblemished unmistakable sparkle of &mdash; the diamond on her grandmother's ring. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
</ul>

Here is another example:

<ul>
<li> Familiarity breeds contempt — and children. <img src="../images/tick.png"/> (Mark Twain)</li>
(The original is written with three dots to create a pause for effect.)
</ul>

<center>
<div class="messageBox warning">
<center><b>Good News and Bad News</b></center><br><br>
<b>Good news!</b> There are specific rules about when to use a semicolon, a colon, or three dots, so you have to know what you're doing if you choose one of them. One of the good things about a dash is that it can be used as a substitute for all three.<br><br>

<b>Bad news!</b> Using dashes every single time is not a good look. It will also cut down on your options for expressing yourself and showcasing your grammar skills. Therefore, you must still learn how to use the others. (You could think of the dash as a get-out-of-jail-free card that you can use occasionally.)
</div>
</center>

Note: If you're a stickler for the rules, use an <i>em dash</i> to extend a sentence. You will get away with an <i>en dash</i> or a hyphen.<br><br>

<a href='../lessons/extend_a_sentence.htm'>Read more about dashes to extend a sentence</a>.

<h2>(4) Using Dashes as Parentheses</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/dashes_parentheses.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="dashes used as parentheses (brackets)"/><br><br>
</center>

We're all familiar with putting explanations or afterthoughts in brackets (just like this). But, brackets are just one of the choices you have for inserting extra information into a sentence. You can also use commas or dashes. For example:

<ul>
<li> Mark Jones (who  has lived in our village for 20 years) is the world Scrabble champion and the national Bananagrams champion. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(brackets used)
<li> Mark Jones &mdash; who  has lived in our village for 20 years &mdash; is the world Scrabble champion and the national Bananagrams champion. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(dashes used)
<li> Mark Jones, who  has lived in our village for 20 years, is the world Scrabble champion and the national Bananagrams champion. <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(commas used)
</ul>

You don't need to justify using dashes for parentheses, but just be aware that they can look a little stark.<br><br>

Note: If you're a stickler for the rules, use an <i>em dash</i> for parentheses. You will get away with <i>en dashes</i> or hyphens.<br><br>

<a href='../lessons/parenthesis_choice_of_parentheses.htm'>Read more about dashes for parentheses</a>.


<h2>(5) Using Dashes to Credit Quotations</h2>

<center>
<img src="pics/dashes_quote.png" class="resize sidelink" alt="dashes used with quotations"/><br><br>
</center>

You can use an <i>em dash</i> to credit a quote to someone. For example: 

<ul>
<li>"There used to be a real me, but I had it surgically removed." &mdash; Peter Sellers (1925&ndash;1980)  <img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
(Note the <i>em dash</i> before Peter Sellers and the <i>en dash</i> between the dates.)
</ul>

Here is another example:

<ul>
<li>"Name the greatest of all inventors. Accident." — Mark Twain (1835–1910) <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li> 
</ul>

Note: You should use an <i>em dash</i> when crediting a quotation. An <i>en dash</i> or hyphen looks wrong.

<h2>Be Consistent When Formatting Dashes</h2>

Most people like to see a dash (an <i>en dash</i> or an <i>em dash</i>) with a space before and after. For example:

<ul>
<li> Skip &mdash; a guard dog for Bonds Ltd in Bury &mdash; hospitalized two burglars before returning to eat the steaks they had thrown him. 
<img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul> 

However, it is possible to omit the spaces, especially with <i>em dashes</i>. For example:

<ul>
<li> Skip&mdash;a guard dog for Bonds Ltd in Bury&mdash;hospitalized two burglars before returning to eat the steaks they had thrown him. 
<img src="../images/tick.png" /></li>
</ul>

The options are listed in order of popularity: 

<ul>
<li><b>en dashes with spaces</b><br>(e.g., Bill &ndash; aged 17 &ndash; won the cup.) </li>(Note: This is only the most popular because people use hyphens instead of en dashes.)
<li><b>em dashes with spaces</b><br>(e.g., Bill &mdash; aged 17 &mdash; won the cup.)</li>
(Note: This is a good option to show you know the difference between a hyphen and a dash.)
<li><b>em dashes without spaces</b><br>(e.g., Bill&mdash;aged 17&mdash;won the cup.)</li>
(Note: This is a possibility. It could be useful to keep the whole thing on one line when using a PC.)
<li><b>en dashes without spaces</b><br>(e.g., Bill&ndash;aged 17&ndash;won the cup.)</li>
(Note: This is a possibility too.)
</ul> 




<h2>Why Should I Care about Dashes?</h2>
It's worth learning about dashes to make use of their versatility, but, if that's not enough, here are two more good reasons to include more dashes in your work.  

<h2>(Reason 1) A dash will be safe if you're unsure whether to use a colon or a semicolon.</h2>
Look at these two examples:

<ul>
<li> Take my advice — I don't use it anyway.</li>
(Here, the dash replaces a semicolon (;). A colon would be wrong because nothing in "sentence" 2 renames anything in "sentence" 1.)
<li> Take my advice — stay alive.</li>
(In this example, the dash replaces a colon (:). A semicolon would be wrong because "sentence" 2 renames my advice in "sentence" 1. In other words, "sentence" 2 is an appositive of "my advice.")
</ul>

Appositive? Renaming? Sentences 1 and 2? It's all a bit confusing.<br><br>

If you're unsure whether to use a semicolon or a colon, use a dash. It covers both roles. Dashes are stark though, and a page full of dashes is not a good look. Yes, dashes are safe, but they're a bit slapdash (pun intended).


<h2>(Reason 2) Dashes used as parenthetical punctuation are unmistakably clear.</h2>
When dashes are used to mark a <a href="../glossary/parenthesis.htm">parenthesis</a> (an explanation or afterthought that you'd happily put between brackets or commas), they demarcate your parenthesis starkly. That could be a good thing to give your parenthesis some emphasis. But, dashes can look a little unwieldy. Nevertheless, they're a good alternative for brackets when brackets might be too informal and for commas when the sentence already has lots of commas. For example:

<ul>
<li>Last week, Dr. Mark Jones &mdash; a resident of Bexley since he graduated from Bexley Secondary School in 1990 &mdash; was crowned, for the second year running, the world Scrabble champion.  <img src="../images/tick.png"/></li>
(In this example, the writer did not want to use brackets because they would seem too informal and did not want to use commas because there were too many other commas in the sentence.)
</ul>

<div class="sidelink" style="margin-top: 3em;">
<h2 class="text-centred">Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you're unsure whether to use a colon or a semicolon, use a dash. Easy life.</li> 
<li>If you need a parenthesis to stand out — I mean really stand out — replace your breezy brackets or confusing commas with daring dashes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Too or To?</h2>

What is the difference between "too" and "to"?<br><br>

<b>"Too" has two meanings:</b>

<ul>
<li>(1) "Too" means "as well." For example:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Your eye is swollen. Your lip is swollen <span class="highlight">too</span>.</li>
	</ul>

<li>(2) "Too" conveys the idea of "in excess." For example:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Your cat is <span class="highlight">too</span> fat.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>


<b>"To" also has two means</b>

<ul>
<li>(1) "To" is a <a href="../lessons/prepositions.htm">preposition</a>. For example:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Give it <span class="highlight">to</span> him.</li>
	</ul>

<li>(2) "To" shows the <a href="../glossary/infinitive_form.htm">infinitive form of a verb</a>. For example:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>I want <span class="highlight">to</span> run.</li>

                        What DuVernay has delivered is essentially a feature-length screensaver which operates on the assumption that cinema for children is a matter of bright colours and dippy sentiment.

                        A Wrinkle in Time unevenly ambles along with a nice message about families, love and self-acceptance, and sprinkled with some visually spectacular sequences. But it's ultimately unsatisfying for anyone over 15 years old.

                        Somehow I doubt that Disney is about to spawn another franchise from what we have here. Maybe children will get more fun from reading the books. Now there's a thought.

                        Contains good messages for kids and some visuals that will make your eyeballs dance and it is made with heart but - there's always a 'but' when I discuss this movie - it feels like it bites off more than it can chew.

                        In spite of its length and muddled storyline, A Wrinkle in Time is still worth recommending for its visuals and for its leading performances.

                        Some stories work far better in literature than on the screen, as the screenwriters scrap necessary connecting tissue to trim the runtime down to two hours.

                        I was really looking forward to the idea of it being one of those stories for young girls and kids, the STEM aspect of it, sci-fi... technology... but this is more of a fantasy.

                        The film's themes of love, family and self-acceptance are powerful enough to resonate with audiences. But the concept and casting shouldn't be the most magical parts of a fantasy film, no matter how enchanting its message is.

                        What DuVernay has delivered is essentially a feature-length screensaver which operates on the assumption that cinema for children is a matter of bright colours and dippy sentiment.

                        Contains good messages for kids and some visuals that will make your eyeballs dance and it is made with heart but - there's always a 'but' when I discuss this movie - it feels like it bites off more than it can chew.

                        Some stories work far better in literature than on the screen, as the screenwriters scrap necessary connecting tissue to trim the runtime down to two hours.

                        A glimmer of a heart but has a massive hole in its universal soul, lacklustre performances and a weak plot with more holes than Swiss cheese.

                        <div class="mop-audience-reviews__review--comment clamp clamp-4 js-clamp">Based on the much loved children&#39;s book of the same name, &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; carries a great sense of wonder and awe bought towards it&#39;s narrative, even with a great sense of visual flare to go along with it&#39;s gifted performers the film is very watchable to all viewers or especially it&#39;s target audience (family/kids). However, despite the eye-catching gazes and genuine sense of otherworldly surrealism that perpetuates the hearts and minds of all audiences, it&#39;s neither a great film within itself, nor is it a great adaptation. This doesn&#39;t just account to how many liberties were taken in the adaptation process, but more within the overall story itself. It&#39;s perfectly elaborate scale and heart-warming messages kind of want to offer more than what was briefly glimpsed at or even explored in the overall narrative that would have benefited the overarching style of this film willing to be both faithful to it&#39;s source material counterpart and creative piece of family-friendly Disney-esque surreal cinema. Thus the overall film offers a decent viewing experience for it&#39;s moral/themes and sense of adventure, but doesn&#39;t fulfill the greater aspect of it&#39;s ambitions nor it&#39;s tremendous world-building mechanics to really be very measurable to it&#39;s source material counterpart. Recommended with caution nonetheless, especially to those within it&#39;s target audience.</div>

Unsure if hybrids are the cause or result of the virus, many humans fear and hunt them. After a decade of living safely in his secluded forest home, a sheltered hybrid deer-boy named Gus (Christian Convery) unexpectedly befriends a wandering loner named Jepperd (Nonso Anozie). Together they set out on an extraordinary adventure across what's left of America in search of answers -- about Gus' origins, Jepperd's past, and the true meaning of home. But their story is full of unexpected allies and enemies, and Gus quickly learns the lush, dangerous world outside the forest is more complex than he ever could have imagined.

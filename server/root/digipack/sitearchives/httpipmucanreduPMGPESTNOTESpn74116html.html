      <p>The adult raccoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) is a stocky mammal about 2 to 3 feet long and weighs 7 to 30 pounds. It is distinctively marked with a black &ldquo;mask&rdquo; over the eyes and is heavily furred with alternating light and dark rings around its tail. Raccoons are active year-round but may take cover in dens during periods of severe winter weather.</p>
     
<a name="BIOLOGY"></a>
	  <h4>IDENTIFICATION AND BIOLOGY</h4>
	  <p>Raccoons prefer wooded areas near water and natural habitats. They den in hollow trees, ground burrows, brush piles, or rock crevices. This nocturnal animal adapts extremely well to urban and suburban environments, where it often dens in backyards, beneath decks, or in accessible outbuildings. Attics, chimneys, and the spaces beneath houses are also used as dens, if access can be gained. Because they are active mainly at nighttime, raccoons are often present but may go undetected for some time.</p>
      
	  <p>  Raccoons are omnivorous, eating both plants and animals. Plant foods include all kinds of fruits, berries, nuts, acorns, corn, and other types of grain. Animal foods include crayfish, clams, fish, frogs, snails, insects, turtles, rabbits, muskrats, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds, including waterfowl. In urban settings, in addition to feeding on backyard fruits, nuts, and vegetables, they scavenge from garbage cans and compost piles. Pet food left outside overnight ranks high as a food resource, and some people intentionally provide food for raccoons. Bird feeders provide another dependable food source for raccoons.</p>
      
      <p>Young are generally born in April or May, but earlier and later litters are not uncommon. Litter size ranges from three to six young, averaging about four. Family groups usually remain together for the first year; the year-old young begin to assert their independence the following year when the new litter arrives. Because of the availability of food and den sites, urban and suburban raccoon populations can become very large.</p>
      
<h4><a name="DAMAGE"></a>DAMAGE</h4>
<p>Common problems occur when raccoons look for nesting sites in buildings. Females in search of nesting sites may rip off shingles, fascia boards, or rooftop ventilators to get into the attic. Once inside the attic, insulation on walls may be torn up and displaced; and insulation on heating and air conditioning ducts may be ripped off and destroyed. Raccoons may begin using an area of the attic for a latrine, and the ceiling beneath may become stained with urine, accompanied by an objectionable odor. Ectoparasites may infest the attic and migrate to other parts of the house. Uncapped chimneys are often used as den sites, as are spaces beneath porches and decks. Doors covering crawl spaces are sometimes damaged in an effort to den beneath the house.</p>

<p>  Raccoon damage to gardens is quite common. Sweet corn is particularly desirable. Raccoons will climb the stalk and tear it down to gain access to the corn. Damage usually occurs right before harvest. Other fruits and vegetables in the garden can also be consumed. Raccoons often will roll up newly laid turf when looking for worms and grubs. However, they do not typically dig holes in lawns when looking for food; if you see conical-shaped holes in your yard, this is likely the result of skunk foraging.&nbsp; For more information on skunks, see Pest Note: <i><a href="/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74118.html">Skunks</a></i>. Raccoons are skilled fishers; as such, they occasionally prey upon koi in backyard ponds. </p>

 <p> Raccoons are known to carry a number of diseases and internal parasites. The raccoon roundworm, an infection spread to people by the accidental ingestion or inhalation of roundworm eggs from raccoon feces, has caused increased concern in recent years. Roundworm infection can cause serious disabilities, and young children are thought to be most susceptible. Raccoons are also carriers of rabies and distemper. Be sure pets are properly vaccinated to mitigate this threat.</p>
 
<h4><a name="LEGAL"></a>LEGAL STATUS</h4>

	  <p>In California raccoons are classified as furbearers. The fur harvest season is set by the <a href="https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/">California Department of Fish and Wildlife</a>, which further determines when and how raccoons may be taken. Raccoons causing damage may be taken at any time by legal means. The <a href="https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/">California Department of Fish and Game</a> Regulations prohibit the relocation of raccoons and other wildlife without written permission of the Department. For further information, contact the Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
      
<a name="MANAGEMENT"></a>
   <h4>MANAGEMENT</h4>

     <p>There are various approaches to resolving raccoon problems. In some communities the situation has become so severe that it is beyond the ability of the individual homeowner to solve the problem. In these instances, a community effort may be the only effective solution. City parks, green belts, golf courses, and highway and street plantings may serve as reservoirs for raccoons by providing them with den sites and travel routes. Storm drains and street and road culverts are commonly used as dens. Since these areas are under the control or management of the city, it is often imperative that the city be involved in finding solutions. The city can also invoke and enforce a ban on feeding raccoons, help to educate the public on the best ways to handle an area-wide urban raccoon problem, and discourage individuals from live trapping and relocating animals, which only exacerbates the problem.</p>
     
<h5>Detection</h5>
      <p>Raccoons in the garden may be observed at night or they may come up to a sliding glass door and peer inside. Evidence of feeding, tracks, and droppings may provide clues to their visits. Of course, noises on the roof, in the chimney, or in the attic may also indicate their presence. An occasional visit by a raccoon or a family of raccoons may not be a cause for major concern; but if these visits become commonplace and raccoons are also climbing on your roof, some action is probably warranted. </p>
     
     

<h5>Habitat Modification</h5>
      <p>Raccoons are attracted to gardens or homes because they offer a food resource and potential den sites. Efforts to reduce available food can include using metal garbage cans with secure lids. To prevent raccoons from tipping over garbage cans, place the cans in a rack or tie them to a secure post. A bungee cord or wire can also be used to secure lids. Pet food left outdoors should be removed before nightfall to keep raccoons from feeding from pet dishes. Pick up fallen fruits and nuts frequently. Never intentionally provide food for raccoons and discourage your neighbors from this practice as well; it only attracts more raccoons.</p>
      
      <p>If possible, remove woodpiles or other materials raccoons can den in or under. Thinning out overgrown shrubbery will reduce cover. To reduce access to the roof, tree branches that overhang rooftops should be cut back; if possible, leaving a gap of at least 5 feet between the roof and the tree. Trellises and arbors attached to homes may facilitate access to the roof and consideration should be given to their removal. While habitat modification is often helpful, it is rarely a total solution.</p>
      
<h5>Exclusion</h5>
      <p>Exclusion is the key to eliminating den sites but remember that raccoons are powerful animals and can become vicious when cornered. Their front paws are handlike, with toes that are long, flexible, and considerably dexterous. Raccoons are known to unhook simple latches.</p>
      
      <p>  Prevent access to chimneys by covering them with a spark arrester that meets the fire code of your area. These caps will keep raccoons, tree squirrels, rats, and birds out of the chimney. The caps should be tightly secured to prevent raccoons from pulling them loose. Be sure that no animals are currently inside the chimney before covering the opening. If raccoons are currently nesting in your chimney, hiring professionals is often the only effective option for removing them. </p>
      
      <p>  Open spaces beneath structures, such as porches, decks, and garden and tool sheds, should be tightly screened with 10-gauge 1/4- or 1/3-inch galvanized hardware mesh. The bottom edge of the wire should be buried at least 6 inches deep, extended outward for 12 inches, and then back-covered with soil. Such measures will exclude not only raccoons but also skunks, opossums, squirrels, and rats.</p>
      
      <p>  Ordinary fences will not keep raccoons from gardens or yards, as the animals will either dig under or climb over them. Raccoons readily locate weaknesses in fences and will rip off loose boards or enlarge holes in wire fences for easy access. By exploiting the raccoon&rsquo;s sensitivity to electric shock, an ordinary fence can be made raccoon-proof by adding a single electrified strand of wire 8 inches above the ground and about 8 inches out from the base of the fence. A pulsating high-voltage, low-amperage fence charger, similar to that used for confining cattle, is used to electrify the fence. Electrified wire wrapped around the trunk of a tree will discourage climbing. A low, two-wire electric fence can be very effective for excluding raccoons from sweet corn, melons, and other highly preferred crops. The two wires are fastened on evenly spaced wooden posts; one wire is 6 inches above the ground and the other is 12 inches above the ground. The fence charger needs to be activated only from dusk to dawn. This type of low electric fence can be installed around a newly laid sod lawn to prevent raccoons from rolling back the new sod in search of insects or grubs. The fence is removed once the turf has taken root. Such fences around ponds are sometimes used to protect koi and goldfish from raccoons.</p>
      
      <p>Before installing an electric fence, explore the pros and cons of its use; and, if used, be sure the electric charger is appropriate for the task. Remember that electrified fences are not appropriate for all situations, must be installed properly, and should always be identified with warning signs.</p>
      
<h5>Frightening</h5>
      <p>A variety of materials, gadgets, and devices designed to frighten raccoons and other wildlife are on the market. These include flashing lights, sound-producing devices, and water-squirting units, all of which can be activated by motion detectors. In addition, radios, scarecrows, and flags and windmills that spin or flutter in the wind have been used. These devices can be effective for a few days. However, raccoons often quickly learn that there is no threat associated with these devices, at which time they cease to be effective.</p>
      
<h5>Repellents</h5>
       <p>There are a few commercial chemical repellents available to repel various forms of wildlife, but none have been effective for raccoons. Mothballs, blood meal, and a wide variety of other home remedies have been tried to no avail, as raccoons are quick to adapt.</p>
       
<h5>Trapping</h5>
	    <p>For the average homeowner unfamiliar with trapping raccoons, it is advisable to hire a professional wildlife control operator to remove the animal. The professional will have the proper equipment to accomplish the task and will be able to tell if a trapped female is nursing its young. This is very important because you don&rsquo;t want to leave young behind to starve. The professional will also have the means to euthanize the animals, since releasing them elsewhere is prohibited by law (unless a permit to relocate the raccoon has been obtained from <a href="https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/">California Department of Fish and Wildlife</a>). Released animals may return or present a problem to someone else; and, in fact, the animal you have trapped may have been deliberately released near you. Release of animals is a major factor in the dissemination of numerous diseases to other animals including pets and humans. Some counties have trapping programs for nuisance animals, including raccoons. Contact your local agricultural commissioner to see if this service is available.</p>
        
<p>Raccoons are fairly easy to trap; however, occasionally a clever and cunning animal will be quite elusive. A live cage-type trap is usually the preferred trap for homeowners, although others are available that may be used by professionals to capture the more difficult animals. The single-door trap should be sturdily constructed and its dimensions should be at least 10 x 12 x 32 inches. Larger 15 x 15 x 36 inch traps are even better. Canned tuna or canned fish-flavored cat food make excellent baits but may also attract nontarget cats and dogs. To avoid catching cats, try using marshmallows, grapes, prunes, peanut butter, or sweet rolls. Small pieces of bait should be placed along a path leading up to the trap. The rear of the trap should be covered with 1/2-inch wire mesh to prevent the raccoon from reaching through the trap from the outside to steal the bait. Traps should be well anchored to the ground or weighted to prevent the animal from tipping the trap over to obtain the bait. Traps should be set at night and closed in the morning to avoid trapping nontargets. Remember, raccoons are intelligent and clever animals. They are also powerful and can be vicious when trapped or cornered.</p>
       
<h5>Other Control Methods</h5>
<p>Dogs kept outdoors may alert you to the presence of raccoons and may frighten some away; however, some raccoons will attack dogs and cause serious injuries. Since they are usually active at night when they are most difficult to see, shooting is rarely the solution to nuisance raccoons. Additionally, most municipalities do not allow the discharge of firearms within their boundaries. However, in rural areas, shooting can sometimes provide an effective solution to a persistent raccoon problem. </p>

					<p>Integrated pest management, or IPM, is a process you can use to solve pest problems while minimizing risks to people and the environment. IPM can be used to manage all kinds of pests anywhereâ€“in urban, agricultural, and wildland or natural areas. </p> 
						<span id="DEFINITION"></span>
						<h2>Definition of IPM</h2>
					<p>IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties. Pesticides are used only after monitoring indicates they are needed according to established guidelines, and treatments are made with the goal of removing only the target organism. Pest control materials are selected and applied in a manner that minimizes risks to human health, beneficial and nontarget organisms, and the environment. </p>
						<blockquote>
            				<strong>What is a pest?</strong><br>
            				<i>Pests are organisms that damage or interfere with desirable plants in our fields and orchards, landscapes, or wildlands, or damage homes or other structures. Pests also include organisms that impact human or animal health.  Pests may transmit disease or may be just a nuisance. A pest can be a plant (weed), vertebrate (bird, rodent, or other mammal), invertebrate (insect, tick, mite, or snail), nematode, pathogen (bacteria, virus, or fungus) that causes disease, or other unwanted organism that may harm water quality, animal life, or other parts of the ecosystem.</i> 
            			</blockquote> 
						<span id="HOW"></span>
						<h2>How Does IPM Work?</h2>
					<h3>IPM focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage by managing the ecosystem</h3>
						<p>With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a building. </p>
						<p>Rather than simply eliminating the pests you see right now, using IPM means you'll look at environmental factors that affect the pest and its ability to thrive. Armed with this information, you can create conditions that are unfavorable for the pest. </p>
						
						<h3>In IPM, monitoring and correct pest identification help you decide whether management is needed</h3>
						<p>Monitoring means checking your field, landscape, forest, or buildingâ€”or other siteâ€”to identify which pests are present, how many there are, or what damage they've caused. Correctly identifying the pest is key to knowing whether a pest is likely to become a problem and determining the best management strategy.</p>
						<p>After monitoring and considering information about the pest, its biology, and environmental factors, you can decide whether the pest can be tolerated or whether it is a problem that warrants control. If control is needed, this information also helps you select the most effective management methods and the best time to use them. </p>
						
						<h3>IPM programs combine management approaches for greater effectiveness</h3>
						<p>The most effective, long-term way to manage pests is by using a combination of methods that work better together than separately. Approaches for managing pests are often grouped in the following categories.</p>
						<dl>
			                <dt>Biological control</dt>
								<dd>Biological control is the use of <i>natural enemies</i>â€”predators, parasites, pathogens, and competitorsâ€”to control pests and their damage. Invertebrates, plant pathogens, nematodes, weeds, and vertebrates have many natural enemies.</dd>
			                <dt>Cultural controls</dt>
			                	<dd>Cultural controls are practices that reduce pest establishment, reproduction, dispersal, and survival. For example, changing irrigation practices can reduce pest problems, since too much water can increase root disease and weeds.</dd>
			                <dt>Mechanical and physical controls</dt>
			                	<dd>Mechanical and physical controls kill a pest directly, block pests out, or make the environment unsuitable for it. Traps for rodents are examples of mechanical control. Physical controls include mulches for weed management, steam sterilization of the soil for disease management, or barriers such as screens to keep birds or insects out.</dd>
			                <dt>Chemical control</dt>
			                	<dd>Chemical control is the use of pesticides. In IPM, pesticides are used only when needed and in combination with other approaches for more effective, long-term control. Pesticides are selected and applied in a way that minimizes their  possible harm to people, nontarget organisms, and the environment. With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the safest for other organisms and for air, soil, and water quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds instead of an entire area.</dd>

						<h2>IPM Programs</h2>
					<p>These IPM principles and practices are combined to create <i>IPM programs</i>. While each situation is different, six major components are common to all IPM programs:</p>
						<ol>
			                <li>Pest identification</li>
			                <li>Monitoring and assessing pest numbers and damage</li>
			                <li>Guidelines for when management action is needed</li>
			                <li>Preventing pest problems</li>
			                <li>Using a combination of biological, cultural, physical/mechanical and chemical management tools</li>
			                <li>After action is taken, assessing the effect of pest management</li>
			            </ol>

Natural enemies that limit pests are key components of integrated pest management programs. Important natural enemies of insect and mite pests include predators, parasites, and pathogens.</p>

<p>The UC IPM Natural Enemies Gallery includes natural enemy species commonly found on California farms and in landscapes. Additional species will be added over time.</p>
<p>For more information about natural enemies, purchase the <a href="/IPMPROJECT/ADS/manual_naturalenemies.html">Natural Enemies Handbook</a>.</p>

<h2>What we do</h2>

<p>The University of California Statewide IPM Program (UC IPM) helps residents, growers, land managers, community leaders, and other professional pest managers prevent and solve pest problems with the least unintended impacts on people and their surroundings.</p>

<p>The program draws on expertise of University of California scientists to develop and distribute UC's best information on managing pests using safe and effective techniques and strategies that protect people and the environment. These techniques and strategies are the basis of integrated pest management, or IPM.</p>

<p class="top75">UC IPM works through <a href="/GENERAL/ceofficefinder.html">Cooperative Extension</a> to deliver information to clients in every California county. Web and printed publications provide a wealth of how-to information about identifying and managing pests, and the program also provides online training courses. </p>

<h2>The organization</h2>

<p>UC IPM is a part of the <a href="http://www.ucanr.org/">UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR)</a>. More than 20 UC IPM employees develop and deliver programs in agricultural, urban and community, and natural resources IPM. (<a href="/PDF/MISC/ucipm-orgchart.pdf">Organizational chart PDF</a>)</p>

<a name="MISSION" id="MISSION"></a>
<h2>Our mission</h2>

<p class="top5 bottom25">&nbsp;The mission of the UC IPM Program is to:</p>
	<ul class="nospc">
		<li>Increase utilization of ecologically based integrated pest management programs</li>
		<li>Provide leadership in IPM including building coalitions and partnerships that link with communities and public agencies</li>
		<li>Increase the predictability and effectiveness of pest management techniques</li>
		<li>Develop science-based pest management programs that are economically and environmentally sustainable, and socially appropriate</li>
		<li>Protect human health and the environment by reducing risks caused by pests and pest management practices</li>
  </ul>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->
	<p>The UC Statewide IPM Program provides practical information on pest management techniques and identification for a broad range of California pests. Management suggestions apply to California, but they may be useful in other areas also. </p>

<div class="photobox"><img src="/IMAGES/photos/S-WO-SCEN-SC.058z.jpg" width="250" height="435" style="margin-top: 20px;" alt="Cultivating a home vegetable garden with raised beds."  title="Cultivating a home vegetable garden with raised beds.">

</div>

<h2>Pest management</h2>

<h3 class="caps">QUICK TIPS</h3>
<p>Quick Tips are very short-answer fact sheets aimed at consumers and nonprofessional audiences.Â  Compiled by UC IPM staff, Quick Tips are drawn directly from the information contained in the Pest Notes <i>(see below)</i> and reviewed by the original authors. Quick Tips are reviewed and revised when their corresponding Pest Notes are updated. </p>

<h3 class="caps">Pest Notes</h3>
<p>Pest Notes are longer publications about specific pests or pest management practices, written for home gardeners, residents, UC Master Gardeners, landscape professionals, public agency professionals, and managers of wildlands and open spaces.</p>

<p>Authored by University of California scientists, each Pest Note is peer reviewed through the UC ANR process.Â  As a series coordinated by a technical editor, they follow format and content guidelines established by the UC IPM Program and are edited, produced, and often illustrated by UC IPM staff.Â  Once published, each document is reviewed periodically, typically about every 5 years, and updated as needed.</p>

<h3 class="caps">Other content</h3>

<p>The home and garden section of our Web site also includes information from other UC ANR resources, primarily peer-reviewed UC IPM books and products, including <a href="/IPMPROJECT/ADS/manual_landscape.html">Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs</a>, <a href="/IPMPROJECT/ADS/manual_gardenfarms.html">Pests of the Garden and Small Farm</a>, and <a href="/IPMPROJECT/ADS/manual_floriculture.html">Integrated Pest Management for Floriculture</a>.Â  The <a href="/TOOLS/TURF/acknowled.html">UC Guide to Healthy Lawns</a>, <a href="/WATER/U/index.html">Pesticides and Water Quality</a>, and the <a href="/TOOLS/ANTKEY/credit.html">Key to Identifying Common Household Ants</a> are separately authored and reviewed resources.</p>
<h2>Pesticide information</h2>

	<p>Please note that the pesticides suggested throughout our Web site conformed to the registered California pesticide labels at the time the publications were published or last reviewed. Pesticide registrations change frequently at both the state and federal levels, and UC IPM staff update the databases when notified. Ultimately, users are responsible for ensuring that their use conforms to current labels and local regulations.</p>
	<p><b>Our pages do not contain indexes of state or federal pesticide registrations</b>. They list only those pesticides specifically suggested by the authors as being effective against the pest and compatible with the goals of the pest management program. Our pages do not provide labels, complete label directions, or complete label information. Before each pesticide application, make sure you have a current pesticide label and be sure to follow its instructions. Check with your county agricultural commissioner for the latest restricted interval requirements.</p>
	<p>To simplify information, trade names of products (and, in some cases, specific formulations) may be used. No endorsements of named products are intended, nor is criticism implied of similar products that are not mentioned. </p>

      <p>Two species of skunk are found in California, the spotted skunk (<i>Spilogale gracilis</i>) and the striped skunk (<i>Mephitis mephitis</i>), which is the species most commonly found around homes. Although originally considered members of the weasel family, recent genetic research has placed skunks into their own family Mephitidae. Both skunk species produce an oily, yellow sulfur-alcohol compound that contains sulfuric acid. This pungent liquid is stored in two separate scent glands located on each side of the anus and can be squirted accurately at targets as far as 6 to 10 feet away as a self-defense mechanism. The secretion is acrid enough to cause nausea and can produce severe burning and temporary blindness if it strikes the eyes.</p>
    
    <a name="IDENTIFICATION"></a>
    <h4>IDENTIFICATION AND BIOLOGY</h4>
<p>Skunks have a triangular-shaped head and a moderately elongated body with short, muscular legs and long, sharp non-retractable claws. The striped skunk is about the size of an adult house cat, and its fur is mostly black with white on top of the head and neck. In most animals the white extends down the back, usually separating into two white stripes. Spotted skunks are black with white spots or short white streaks. They are smaller than the striped skunk, about half the size of a house cat.</p>



	   <p>Striped skunks are primarily active at dawn, dusk, and at night but can be active during the daytime, particularly in human-use areas. Spotted skunks rarely venture out during the daytime. Both skunk species consume a highly-varied diet including insects, grubs, earthworms, small rodents, snakes, lizards, frogs, mushrooms, berries and fruit, pet food, and garbage. Skunks will also opportunistically feed on bird eggs, which can result in substantial losses to ground-nesting birds when skunk densities are high. Food items found in their diet will vary seasonally depending on availability.</p>
       
	   <p>  Breeding usually occurs during February and March for the striped skunk; gestation time is about 9 weeks and litters range from 4 to 6 kits. After 2 to 3 months, the kits can be seen following their mother as she makes her nightly rounds in search of food. Skunks are capable of breeding the spring following birth. The average life span of skunks is around 2 to 3.5 years, although they can occasionally live up to 7 years in the wild.</p>
       
	   <p>  Skunks often den in burrows. They will often use abandoned burrows dug by ground squirrels, foxes, or coyotes and will enlarge them if necessary. If dens are scarce, they will readily use brush piles, hollow logs, and culverts. In urban settings, they den under decks, porches, or beneath buildings. If other suitable dens are unavailable, skunks will dig their own dens. Skunks do not hibernate; but in regions with colder weather, they may congregate in communal dens during the winter.</p>
       
	   <p>  Skunks are attracted to residential areas by the availability of food, water, and shelter. They become a nuisance when they live under porches, decks, garden tool sheds, or homes. Their scent is usually not welcome around homes, and they often spray dogs that bark and approach rapidly. They like to feed on ripening berries and fallen fruit and cause other garden problems by digging while in search of grubs and other insects. They often search for food in lawns by digging small pits or cone-shaped depressions that range from 3 to 5 inches across. Like raccoons, they may also damage lawns by rolling back sections of sod in search of insects.</p>
       
	    <p> Skunks have an excellent sense of smell and good hearing, but they have very poor vision. This poor vision explains why they are often hit by cars when crossing roads. A skunk may not react if a person more than 10 feet away is quiet and standing still or moving slowly. Healthy skunks are mild-tempered animals. They are not aggressive and, given the opportunity, prefer to flee rather than fight. They usually only defend themselves when suddenly frightened, cornered, or harmed. Skunks usually provide a warning before discharging their scent by stamping their forefeet rapidly, hissing, and arching their tail over their back. Skunks prefer not to spray given the time required to replenish their spray supply. Therefore, using caution around skunks should substantially reduce the possibility of being sprayed.</p>
        
       <p>Disease concerns occur when skunks take up residence in an urban or suburban setting. In California, skunks are one of the most common carriers of rabies, a viral disease transmitted by the bite of an infected animal. Skunks can also be carriers of other diseases including leptospirosis, listeriosis, canine distemper, canine hepatitis, Q-fever, and tularemia.</p>
       
<a name="LEGAL"></a>
<h4>LEGAL STATUS</h4>
	  <p>The California Fish and Game Code classifies skunks as nongame mammals. The owner or tenant of the premises may lethally remove nongame mammals that are injuring or threatening at any time and in any legal manner. Fish and Game regulations prohibit the relocation of skunks and other wildlife without written permission of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The prevalence of rabies in the skunk population is one of several major reasons for denying requests for relocation. For further information on the legal status of skunks, contact the <a href="https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/">California Department of Fish and Wildlife</a>.</p>
	  
<a name="MANAGEMENT"></a>
<h4>MANAGEMENT</h4>
     
     <p>Because rabies is endemic in the skunk population, some city or county health departments assist in the control of skunks by providing trappers to remove them from residential areas. Some private pest control companies will also trap and remove skunks for a fee. The skunk&rsquo;s tendency to spray their musk-laden spray is sufficient to make them unwelcome visitors, especially in close proximity to homes. However, removing a skunk from a property may not offer a permanent solution if nothing is done to deter other skunks from the property. Several actions can be taken to make gardens, yards, and residences less attractive to skunks.</p>
     
<a name="DETECTION"></a>
<h4>DETECTION</h4>
      <p>Because they are usually active only at low-light hours and at night, many people never see skunks as they travel through neighborhoods or yards. Barking dogs may be the first apparent sign of their presence, and the odor resulting from a skunk/dog confrontation will provide positive evidence. If skunks repeatedly travel through your yard or garden, sooner or later you will detect a faint skunk odor, even if the skunk has not sprayed. As with raccoons, an occasional visit by a skunk or a family of skunks may not be cause for concern; but if these visits become commonplace, some action is probably warranted. During the breeding season, males frequently spray when fighting over females. The presence of these odors in late winter is a signal that skunks might be nearby and that it could be necessary to take appropriate measures to prevent pregnant females from accessing potential nesting sites underneath buildings and other structures.</p>
      
<h5>Habitat Modification</h5>
      <p>The most effective way to make your property less attractive to skunks is by reducing access to food, water, and shelter that the animals need. To reduce food sources, fallen fruit and spilled seed from bird feeders should be removed frequently. Garbage cans should have tight-fitting lids, and food items or table scraps should not be placed in compost bins; use &ldquo;hot&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;cold&rdquo; compost method to process organic waste. Food placed outdoors for pets should be removed by nightfall. Intentionally feeding a wild skunk, even when done with good intentions, is a harmful practice. The skunk or its young may become dependent on the unnatural food source and lose their fear of people. This increases the chance that an adult or child may be bitten. Also, the skunk may be trapped or killed when it wanders into another yard where it is not welcome.</p>
      
      <p>  It is also suggested that the management of grubs and other insects in lawns can reduce food for skunks. In theory, this will deter the animal from further digging. If your lawn is infested with insects or grubs, see <i>Pest Notes: <a href="/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7476.html">Lawn Insects</a></i> or contact your local University of California Cooperative Extension office.</p>
      
     <p> Potential den sites can be limited by cutting back overgrown shrubbery and by stacking firewood tightly, preferably at least 18 inches above the ground. Remove boards, rocks, and debris lying on the ground, as insects that skunks feed on hide under these objects. Also, control mice and rats so that their numbers do not build up and provide an abundant food source for skunks.</p>
     
<h5>Exclusion</h5>
      <p>As with many other vertebrate pests, the best solution for skunk problems beneath porches or buildings is to screen or block them out. Close off all potential entrances or openings under houses, garden tool sheds, mobile homes, porches, and decks with 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth. The advantage of using the small mesh is that it will also exclude rats and house mice if installed correctly. Skunks will work hard to get into a desirable denning space, so take care to make fittings good and tight. If there is soil underneath the potential entrances, bury the wire at least 6 inches to discourage skunks from digging under.</p>
      
<p>Once skunks have made their home beneath a building, the problem is a little more difficult because you have to be sure the animals have left before blocking the opening. One way to determine this is to sprinkle a smooth, 1/8-inch thick layer of flour just in front of the point of entrance to form a tracking patch. Examine the tracking patch soon after dark; the presence of footprints will indicate that the animal has left and the opening can be closed. However, blocking the entrance is more problematic if there are several young left behind. If you are not sure that all the skunks beneath a building have left, a one-way, outward-swinging gate can be fashioned that will allow any remaining skunks to leave but not to re-enter. This gate can be constructed from 1/2-inch mesh hardware cloth hinged at the top of the frame and left loose on the other three sides. It must be larger than the opening so that it can only swing outward. Skunks will push it open to leave but will not be able to push it inward to re-enter. This is ineffective, of course, if the kits are not yet mobile; kits not yet able to walk may have to be removed by other means. The placement of one or more floodlights beneath the building facing outward through the skunk&rsquo;s entry point will often assist in driving them away from a location.</p>
     
<h5>Trapping</h5>
	    <p>Skunks can be caught with an enclosed cage-type, live-catch trap. Plastic box traps are superior to wire traps because they are completely enclosed, thus reducing the risk of getting sprayed while removing the trapped animal from the site. If a wire live trap is used, cover the back end with an old blanket when setting the trap. The blanket serves two purposes. First, it provides shelter for the skunk. Secondly, it allows the trapper to slowly cover the entire trap once the skunk is captured. Skunks are less stressed when in dark environments and thus are less likely to spray. Be careful when placing the blanket on the back end of the trap so that it does not interfere with the trigger mechanism. Once the trap has been completely covered with the blanket, the trap can be relocated to a <a href="http://nwco.net/0531-stepthreelethaltoolsandtechniques/5-4-0-CarbonDioxideChamber.asp">carbon dioxide gas chamber</a> for euthanasia. If in a remote area, shooting can also be used to euthanize the trapped skunk. However, skunks usually spray when shot, so shooting may not be the best approach. Note that drowning is not an acceptable or legal form of euthanasia. Once euthanized, skunks can be double-bagged and disposed of in the garbage. </p>
        
<p>Traps can be baited with a variety of foods including sardines, canned cat food, tuna, or bacon. Sweeter foods also work (e.g., peanut butter, apples, melon rinds, marshmallows, doughnuts, etc.) and may be less likely to capture cats.</p>

<p>Individuals who have no experience trapping skunks should hire a professional wildlife control operator. Professionals have the experience and all the necessary equipment to trap and dispatch the animal. An experienced trapper is also much less apt to be sprayed, an event to be avoided if at all possible. Skunks cannot be relocated without a permit, and because of the potential for rabies it is unlikely the California Department of Fish and Wildlife will issue one.</p>
        
<h5>Other Control Methods</h5>
<p>Burrow fumigants such as gas or smoke cartridges may be used in rural areas if the burrows used by skunks can be located and are not under or near buildings. They are not generally recommended for use in residential areas because of the risk of fire and penetration of the gas into buildings. These cartridges are ignited and pushed into the skunk&rsquo;s burrow. The burrow is then sealed off with soil and packed tightly to prevent the toxic and asphyxiating smoke from escaping. Follow the product instructions carefully.</p>

<p>  In rural areas, where firearms can be used and it is safe to do so, skunks may be shot. Since they may spray in the process, be selective in the location chosen for this control method.</p>

<p>  There are no registered toxicants for poisoning skunks. Poison baits sold for the control of rodents should never be used in an attempt to remove skunks. The penalty for such pesticide misuse can be substantial, and illegal poisoning usually comes to light as a result of the accidental poisoning of someone&rsquo;s pet.</p>

<p>  A few commercial products are available for repelling skunks, but unfortunately they are not very effective. A rag soaked with ordinary household ammonia has been used with some reported success as a home remedy repellent for driving skunks from beneath buildings. However, ammonia and other repellents with a strong odor should not be placed under an occupied building since fumes can enter the interior space, especially if air is drawn from beneath the building by a furnace or climate control system.</p>

<h5>Odor Removal</h5>
<p>There are several options for odor removal. The chemical neutroleum-alpha is one of the most useful neutralizers for removing the unpleasant skunk scent on furniture or in buildings, but this material and products containing it are not readily available. There are also other commercial products sold for neutralizing or masking skunk odor. If you cannot find such products easily, contact a professional wildlife control operator who may be able to provide neutroleum-alpha or can tell you where it can be purchased. Do not use neutroleum-alpha on pets or people. If your dog or cat has confronted a skunk, call your veterinarian to determine current recommendations for washing the animal to get rid of skunk odor.</p>

<p>  A home remedy formulation reported by some to be effective is as follows:</p>
<ul class="nospc">
  <li>1 quart 3% hydrogen peroxide</li>
  <li>1/4 cup baking soda</li>
  <li>and 1 teaspoon liquid soap.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Once the hydrogen peroxide is mixed with the baking soda the mixture is unstable and generates oxygen and cannot be bottled or stored. Apparently, oxidation changes the chemical composition of skunk scent so that it no longer smells. When the fresh mixture is applied to items contaminated by skunk odor, the smell diminishes quickly. Any leftover mixture should be diluted several fold with water and poured down the drain. Hydrogen peroxide mixtures can be used safely on pets and people as well as on clothing and furniture. However, care should be taken to keep the mixture out of the eyes. Rinse pets thoroughly with water after treatment.</p>
  
<h5>Skunk Bites</h5>
<p>Rabies, an infectious disease caused by a virus, is found in the saliva of infected animals. It affects only mammals and is transmitted most commonly by a bite. People can survive the bite of a rabid animal but only if medical attention is received in time. A physician should promptly attend to <b>ALL</b> skunk bites, no matter how minor; and the local health department should be notified of the incident. </p>

<p>  Skunks that seem tame or listless and wander about in an unusual manner during daylight hours should be treated with great caution because this behavior is symptomatic of rabies. Also, if they exhibit no fear of people or pets and show some aggressive behavior, chances are quite high that they are rabid.</p>

<p>  If you live in an area where skunks occur, be sure your dogs and cats are routinely vaccinated against rabies. Some dogs will confront skunks whenever they get an opportunity. Even though they suffer when they get sprayed, some dogs never learn. People with a high risk of occupational exposure to rabies should also consult with their physician about the possible benefit of being vaccinated.</p>

    <h2>Find Local Cooperative Extension Offices in the U.S.</h2>
    <p>You can often find solutions to your specific pest management problems 
        through your state's Cooperative Extension Service. This organization 
        is a partnership of the United States Department of Agriculture, the land 
        grant university in your state, and local governments. </p>
		
		<h4>In California</h4>
		<p class="noskip"> Find your local office using the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural 
          Resources directory of <a href="http://ucanr.org/County_Offices/">county 
          Cooperative Extension offices</a>. </p>

        <h4>In other states</h4>
        <p class="noskip">Try the National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) links to <a href="http://www.ace.orst.edu/info/npic/countyext.htm">county 
          extension offices</a> throughout the U.S. </p>

        <p>If the NPIC doesn't provide the information you need, the USDA Cooperative 
        State Research, Education, and Extension Service maintains a page of links 
        to Web sites of the land grant universities. On the <a href="http://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/index.html">map</a>, 
        click on your state or territory. From the links on the resulting page, 
        choose the one with &quot;Cooperative Extension&quot; or &quot;Agricultural 
        Extension&quot; in the name. Then look for a link to &quot;county office&quot; 
        or &quot;local offices.&quot; In a few cases, you may have to try a few 
        choices to locate the correct link.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions (RSS)</h2>
    <p class="topzero">UC IPM offers these subscription feeds to notify you of changes:</p>
    <ul class="topzero" style="list-style-image:url(../IMAGES/icons/rss_icon_12x12.gif)">

    </ul>

<h2>What is RSS?</h2>
    <p class="topzero">RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication."  It's an easy way for you to keep up with news and information that's important to you and helps you avoid the conventional methods of browsing or searching for information on Web sites. This content is called a feed. </p>
    <p> An RSS feed  usually is designated by icons such as <img src="/IMAGES/rssfeed.png" alt="RSS" height="14" width="14"> <img src="/IMAGES/rssblue.jpg" alt="RSS" height="15" width="27"> that appear in your browser's URL bar or on a page with feeds.</p>

<h3><i>Why should I subscribe?</i></h3>
    <p class="topzero"> Using RSS feeds is an easy way to stay informed of changes to the UC IPM Web site without cluttering up your e-mail. You save time, because you don't need to browse the site for new content. </p>

<h2>How do I subscribe to an RSS feed?</h2>
    <ul class="topzero">
      <li>Begin by clicking on any RSS link (above) or RSS feed icon with your browser, or drag and drop an RSS icon to your RSS reader.</li>
      <li>A dedicated RSS reader will have more advanced features and options than browser-based feed readers. Numerous readers are available for download on the Web.</li>
      <li>Once you subscribe to a feed, headlines are available in your browser or reader.         When you see a headline that interests you, just select the link to view the full article. </li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Find your local Cooperative Extension office in the U.S.
        </h2>
      <p>
      You can often find solutions to your specific pest management problems through your state's 
        Cooperative Extension Service. This organization is a partnership of the 
        United States Department of Agriculture, the land grant university in 
        your state, and local governments.<br>
        <br>
        <b>In California</b><br>
        Find your local office using the Division of Agriculture and Natural Resource's 
        directory of county <a href="http://ucanr.org/County_Offices/">Cooperative Extension</a> offices.<br>
        <br>
        <b>In other states</b><br>
        Try the National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) links to 
		<a href="http://www.ace.orst.edu/info/npic/countyext.htm">county 
        extension offices</a> throughout the U.S.
		</p>
      <p>If the NPIC doesn't provide the information you need, the USDA Cooperative 
        State Research, Education, and Extension Service maintains a page of links 
        to Web sites of the land grant universities. On the <a href="http://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/index.html">map</a>, 
        click on your state or territory. From the links on the resulting page, 
        choose the one with &quot;Cooperative Extension&quot; or &quot;Agricultural 
        Extension&quot; in the name. Then look for a link to &quot;county office&quot; 
        or &quot;local offices.&quot; In a few cases, you may have to try a few 
        choices to locate the correct link.
